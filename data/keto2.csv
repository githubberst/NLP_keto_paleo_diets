Below are the findings (see links/tables at bottom).  I was healthiest in 2018 when I was running a lot more (used to compete in running regularly) but with my work, that has waned more.  I wanted to quickly get my liver enzymes in check...and that's exactly what happened.  Substantially.  However, a strange effect happened for me (at least, it is strange in my mind)...my LDL skyrocketed from 124 to 289 today, VLDL dropped from 57 to 37, and HDL modestly increased from 42 to 46.  All within about 6 months.  Worth noting that I took a week-long break from the diet at the end of April when I went on vacation.  But have been back on it since then and have only gotten more organized in my approach by tracking my macros using Carb Manager.

So my concern is...how common are my results?  I'm worried my doctor is going to start pushing statins soon or suggest that I get off keto.  However, all the other information, excluding the LDL and not as robust improvement on the HDL, looks to be on the right side of things.  What are your thoughts from personal experience?

,keto,"I’m sure this has been discussed, but it’s not in the FAQ, and I’m having trouble finding it by searching.

I’m tempted to try and find my specific carb threshold.  I know I can handle more than 25 grams of carbs a day.  I’m guessing 100 is too many.  My life would be a lot easier if I knew the actual number I need to stay below.  

I’m guessing my limit will go down as I lose weight, but right now I’m guessing 45-50?

Has anyone done this?  Is there a good procedure?

It shouldn’t be too hard, I don’t think.  I just need to eat foods with very accurate carb counts and increase each day.  Start with 30, then 35, 40, and so on.  I’d also need to be sure when I get knocked fully out of ketosis.  Are the breath meters accurate, and would they work for this?  Is there a better way?  Perhaps the scale would go up the morning after the first day I’m out?

I was also doing to the gym 2-3 times a week, doing lots of cardio.

Since early December I've shifted my focus to weight and muscle building. I go to the gym 2-3 times a week and am exclusively doing weight lifting. 

I'm wondering if this is why fasting and calorie counting has gotten harder? 

99.99% of my diet is still keto. Keeping my carbs super low. Intaking extra electrolytes. But I still find my hunger and appetite to be ravenous the last few months, making calorie counting and fasting a lot tougher than it was a year ago. 

Curious if anyone has experienced anything similar? Have any tips or advice?

I don't really count macros except protein. I make sure I'm getting plenty of protein. Is it possible that I need to start intaking more fat? I'll admit, I don't eat a lot of red meat currently. I've been eating lots and lots of chicken and pork sausage/bratwurst along with pork rinds, cheese, eggs and spinach salads. 

Should I start eating more red / fatty meat? should I cut down on the weight lifting? My end goal is 195 lbs. and I'm super scared of spiraling out of control and putting all my weight back on.

,keto,"Hi all,

I started keto on Monday (today is day 5). first day was okay, Second day I did not have much appetite and mild nausea. Third day no appetite but forced myself to eat. Fourth day I woke up had breakfast, a couple hours later I was so nauseated and was vomiting. I couldn’t stomach anything for the rest of the day, just drank electrolytes and had chicken sock for dinner. Also had discomfort in my upper abdomen (?stomach/gall bladder). 
I’m a 24 (F) doing the dairy free (lactose intolerant) keto diet due to having M.E/CFS and Lyme and hearing some people do well on keto. I do not have much weigh to lose before I’m underweight. I started at 49kg on Monday and I’m now 47.5, I know most of this is water loss but my bf did comment I felt a bit skinnier. I’m 5ft 2. Pre keto I was eating a varied diet, meat included. 
I have no other keto flu symptoms bar the nausea. I feel less nauseous today but still no appetite and the thought of eating anything with fat in it/meat makes me want to hurl. I have not even experienced cravings for my normal (pre keto) foods even. I’ve had some unsweetened soya yogurt and currently baking some keto bread as I thought that may be a bit easier on my stomach.
I don’t want to give up on the diet but I fear I will not be able to eat enough to maintain my weight. I’ve always struggled with eating very fatty foods. 
I considered eating more protein and lowering the fat I’m eating.
I think my nausea is due to fat not electrolyte imbalance as I am supplementing electrolytes and have no other symptoms of electrolyte imbalance. 
I’m questioning if the high ketone levels are making me nauseous. 
I am relatively sedentary due to my health conditions and according to
Carb manager I should be eating 1428 kcals, 111g fat, 89g protein and 18g carbs. Realistically I think I usually eat (pre keto) more than 1428 kcals as I have a decent metabolism and have maintained a weight of 49-51 kg for years just eating intuitively. 

I am considering:

1: Try to reduce fat and continue with keto, gradually upping fat. The risk is I may lose weight as it may be hard to get enough calories. Maybe I went in too hard with the fat. 
2: Ease of keto, maybe do low carb and gradually increase fats/move towards keto diet 

I am not someone to quit easily but my main concern is weight loss. I really do not want to get thinner!!!

,keto,"I've spent the majority of 2023 back on keto. My intentions were to stay keto most of the year. However, I find that life has gotten the best of me, and I'm unsure if I want to fight to get back to keto or just give myself more time.

2 weeks ago I started back to my seasonal job. I'm also working a part time job. And as luck would have it, a raging case of insomnia that just won't go away. The seasonal job is physically draining. I work outside in the wonderful Missouri heat and humidity, and am on my feet or moving the majority of the time.

I tried sticking to keto the first couple days, but quickly fell right off the wagon. My husband is not a low carb or keto eater, and it just became easier to make one meal we eat together vs a keto and non keto meal.

Because I'm exhausted, not sleeping well, I've noticed myself eating worse than I would like and have had some binges in the last week.

,keto,"Hey guys,

Started keto about 12 weeks ago. Also doing sorta OMAD but that was really a previous habit anyway.

The mental benefits of keto have been absolutely amazing for energy, anxiety and OCD like tendencies and I'm so glad I found it.

I initially went in keto to lose weight, I'm 170cm and was 95kg - I am now 80kg which is insane!

However I do try and exercise a lot, initially I was trying to do the gym everyday like before but keto has made me fall out of love with it.

Whenever I gym it seems I take ages to recover. For example I went on Wednesday, did a pretty heavy session back &amp; core, then yesterday I played golf (9 holes walked about 7km).

Today I feel AWFUL, my joints hurt, my head hurts and I'm tired as hell! My smart watch tells me that my heart rate is above normal resting, my HRV is below normal and my breathing rate is below normal as well

I'd say I'm probably not eating enough but in only really eating when I'm hungry and that's dinner (last night was a pork chop, a half camembert, broccoli, asparagus, stuffed cheese and cauliflower pepper) I also ate a packet of pork scratchings in the day which has about 200 cals.

I also suppliment AT LEAST 1000mg of potassium a day as well as 30mg magnesium and I deffo eat a tonne of salt.

Do I need more food, more electrolytes?

,keto,"Type 2 diabetic with a CGM in my arm. Doing lazy keto and probably not getting enough fat. Staying at 15g - 20g of carbs a day with 2 meals a day, lunch and dinner.

Keto can keep my blood glucose at 150 or under. Without keto, no matter what medicine I take, I can shoot into the 200s easily and stay there for days.

So, today I'm sitting in the 130s before lunch. My son and I run out and I grab some imitation crab meat at the grocery store. I come home, throw some mayo and salt on it, and eat a quick salad.

I ate it, but it didn't taste the same as the normal imitation crab meat I eat.

90 minutes later my blood glucose was 235.

My experience with imitation crab meat is that some places marinade it in something to make it taste more like crab or lobster. And whatever this marinade is, it's full of carbs. I've experimented with the CGM and different stores. I know the one that sells real Alaskan Pollock that has nothing added to it. Sadly, that was not the store I was at today.

2 hours in, it starts to creep down slowly. By dinner time I was in around 160.

6:00 PM rolls around and my wife and I go out to Mission BBQ for dinner. I really like Mission BBQ, because the BBQ sauce is on the table, and not on the food. So, you can eat it without the sauce, or even bring your own.

I get their moist beef brisket, which is super fatty.  Absolutely delicious. No BBQ sauce on it.

8:00 PM rolls around, I check my BG, and it is now 111.

10:00 PM rolls around and I'm at 144. I grab 3 slices of cheddar cheese and have a snack. I fold the cheese in half and stick a piece of Kerrigold butter in there.

Been eating keto since 14 May 23 and have naturally fallen into mostly OMAD.

I had my first crack at keto in 2017-18 and dropped a heap of weight really fast (about 30kgs in 4 months). TBH I had a really unsustainable mindset towards it all so as soon as a big enough hurdle came around (pre-covid illness + shitty work environment leading to chronic fatigue) I went back to the SAD and then some…

I’ve had some major positive changes in my life since then (semi retired) and finally came back to keto with a new and much more enlightened mindset!

,keto,"Sorry for long write up. . But I've been on and off keto for like 5 years now. So I know how it works. Mostly clean. Meaning I'm not the kind to partake in really unhealthy types of fat or protein. The pork every once in a while was not good for me but it's not like I ate bacon daily. 

I have suffered  gout and overall  inflammation for a while, even on keto and in my case it did not make it better. Well it did make my stomach bloating better when I first started keto. 

Years later, my issues are different now. 

Gout is weird. For some people it's sugar. For others it's other things. I've heard of people curing it by eliminating sugar altogether. I did that for years. Never went away. 

Everybody is different. 

We test with our bodies what makes us feel certain way, and certainly, I've discovered that heavy meats (especially if spicy) and too much fat triggers not only the gout But also gut inflammation. I did dozens of tests and they never found anything in gut. 

Im realizing now it's my organs, not so much keto itself. 

Thing is, gout is actually an organ problem. The kidneys can't get rid of uric acid and ends up in joints.

But I've discovered the liver is actually primary line of defense. Doing keto for a while was great as it helped reduce far around organs and body.

But my body reacts to red meats in a different way than others. The heavy metals in the worse quality meats put a strain on liver. As do SOME of the unhealthy  fats. healthy stuff like avocado don't, they feel really good. 

I was getting even symptoms of something like a hernia or appendicitis, bloating lower right. Also costochondritis in chest area. Id do lower abs in gym and get crazy cramps. and as soon as I stopped eating like this the problems went away. I noticed a heat like feeling that would activate simultaneously in all these areas inflammation, the gout in feet, the around chest/heart, and lower right gut distension. 

I started doing long fasting and IF because autophagy heals organs. Problem is... It also increases uric acid levels so gout can flare up. And it did. I was working out twice a day doing long fasting and eating keto and got the worse flare up of my life both feet. 2 weeks bed ridden, unable to walk. Peeing in jars. Going number 2 was like having to plan hiking the Himalayas with a foot injury. 8 feet walk was excruciating pain. 

I'll admit though. I had these supplements that kept it at bay and I ran out, and I was pushing it. Eating beef jerky and red meat every day.

The guy I've been working with a holistic doctor and he's helped me a bunch (more then any mainstream doctor). He says for most everyone else keto works wonders. Low carb, high fat and high protein But for people with gout keto puts undue stress on organs needed to clear it and adds to build up of uric acid. Doctors I've been to don't give af about organs the, medication they give you actually destroys them. And it only treats symptoms, and horribly at that. 

I'm seeing that for me plant based raw, alkaline diet temporarily  is one way to cure it. And sure enough testing it, my inflammation started going away. 

However I still want to do keto. But I'm thinking of doing plant based keto with minimal animal protein (instead of meat,, I'm going to eat more eggs  hard boiled eggs) and stick to healthy fats (avocado and some nuts). It's going to be tough. But I'm pissed after my flare up I started binging on carbs a bit and gained weight back.

I think it's possible to still do keto and clear myself out.... Just a lot tougher. Do you have any resources for keto without meats? It seems hard to get keto plant based protein without carbs..  I'm basically  looking for a healthy alkaline keto with minimal meat protein.

As a Type 2 diabetic who's on keto, ice cream is usually off the menu. But I wondered if they actually got a low carb or sugar-free ice cream, so I asked ""What do they have?"" And the guy replied Vanilla, Chocolate and Vegan ice cream.

now i eat a mix of carnivore and keto mostly carnivore tho because it gets the glucose as low as possible i also fast a little bit. only 3 weeks in and my blood pressure is way more stable my heart is more consistent less beat tripping and it doesnt have random hard pounds i dont wake up with cramping and neuropathy pain at night like usual ect ect lots of good things are happening.

im a little concerned about my hot sauces and spices i use they say zero carbs zero sugar but they have peppers and those spike glucose now youde think its such an insignificant amount it wouldnt matter but i need to use alot of spice to cover up the flavor of everything.

 i cant stand the taste of food because a doctor damaged the nerves in my neck when i was born causing super bad sensory issues. thats actually what lead to all my issues i only ate processed food candy and chips as my meals growing up for my entire life and other unhealthy factors.

 so now im 22 i thought i was gonna die but finally i found the answer. i knew it was my extreme diet that caused my issues but it took a long time for me to find out what sort of damage occurred because as soon as i became a non profitable patient to doctors  they stopped trying to figure out what was wrong. i wasnt profitable to begin with because of my state insurance they will get a low payout.

so i figured it out on my own finally after 3 years of researching. it shouldnt have taken that long but ive been mentally burned out as a result of my body decaying so it took a long time to sift through all the possibilities. conventional doctors said i didnt have diabetes and i stupidly trusted that but i came back around to considering diabetes after i realized you cant trust any doctors that are funded by huge food and pharmacy corporations and that it is illegal for them to speak badly of the food that some of their shareholders produce.

,keto,"I've been on Keto since September. I've lost 25 pounds and since working out I'm sure added a few pounds of muscle. 

There were many motivations. Prior I binge ate and ate out a lot. There are so many reasons for the change that are too long to list but ultimately my wife tried it and lost 7 pounds and then trailed off. 

I've been staying strong. So strong in fact I only cheated twice (2 bites of cheesechake ONE time) and the other eating a non-keto cookie (protein instead) that I thought was Keto. 

The reason for this post is have you ever felt criticized for being on Keto or just a restrictive diet in general. I've had some off putting comments from my wife's side of the family and as well as some co workers. 

What's odd is they see my success. Again I'm 25 pounds leaner.  But when I eat regularly and see I still eat but not divulge in everything that is available (eat a cheeseburger with the cheese and burger but not with a bun). They can't help themselves. 

It's almost like they are envious. Food was my crutch in the past. I stress ate. Now that is far behind me I have very little cravings. I wanted to prove to myself I could have the discipline to diet and then move onto fitness which I have done for about 3 weeks now.  

Why can't people just stay in their lane and keep their comments to themselves. I feel like sometimes people think I have an eating disorder and that I'm there to size them up and make them question their meal choices. 

That is what they feel but that is not my intent. They always are the first to bring it up and then if people that don't know about my diet start to ask questions I engage but I don't boast. I don't have the menality that someone that isn't on Keto is wrong and I am right.

,keto,"I was in search for a better option than granulated Stevia, as the bitter after taste basically destroys the purpose of sugar for me personally. So after reading the forum here I decided to try Xylitol and bought a pack of Total Sweet, as I thought it was 0 carbs and 0 calories. I just received it and when reading the nutrients info, it actually has 100% carbs. So 4 gram of Xylitol has 4 gram of carbs. And it still has a massive amount of calories 240 cal per 100gr. So I feel a bit duped here (duped by my own lack of research).

However, the information states that the carbs in Xylitol are Polyols. Which apparently don't count against your net carbs. Is that true?

I know it’s mostly water loss but I haven’t noticed I’ve been peeing more than usual.

I am worried about losing too much weight, I want to try and maintain a healthy weight on this diet as my goal is to see if it will help my health conditions, not to lose weight as I am already a healthy weight. 
How will I know if I am a healthy weight as if the water losses continue, I will soon have an underweight BMI. How can I tell wether I have lost actual weight (fat/muscle) and need to increase my intake, or wether it is just water loss and I do not need to change anything?
I know the overnight loss is likely water but it is unsettling for me.

I used to have anorexia/bulimia from the ages of 15-20. I consider myself 99% recovered now but making a big dietary change is still scary for me as I do worry about falling into disordered eating again or losing too much weight (not on purpose).

I still get tired but nothing like before, and I don’t have a lot of trouble concentrating. 

I told my sleep doc and he was receptive to me going off the stimulants. I still have what they call sleep inertia, meaning it’s extremely hard to wake and get going, and I can sleep for 12+ hours if I’m not careful. But losing the daytime sleepiness is great.

,keto,"Hey everyone !

I did a bit of research and I know this subject has been touched on quite often, but I couldn't find any particular case that was quite similar to mine.

I went on the keto diet about three weeks ago, being I would say roughly 95% carnivore. At first I felt absolutely great. I reach ketosis in about 4 days and then I got insanely good sleep, I had high libido, my mind was absolutely clear; I basically had all the good side-effects of these types of diet.

Now we're in week three, and my energy levels have been going down for the past week. These past two days I feel like my testosterone absolutely tanked. I feel weak and tired, I have zero energy, zero libido; I can't even complete a workout.I'm operating with a low calorie deficit: roughly 500kcals a day as I do want to lose a bit of weight. I did lose 3.5 kg the first two weeks, but I recently gained back 1kg. I was pretty surprised about that.

I don't count calories and don't really pay attention to my macros, I just make sure to avoid all processed foods, eat mostly fat and protein and that's pretty much it. I had lots of electrolyte drinks in the beginning as I did go through keto flu and that mostly fixed things. The weakness I've been feeling these past couple of days is a bit different than I felt in the beginning ?

,keto,"Thought I'd pass along my fasting story and having to go low carb because of insulin resistance even AFTER 10+ years of 48hrs+ once a week intermittent fasting.

Circa 2013ish I did routine bloodwork and my doc started making ""overweight"", ""prediabetic"", ""triglycerides way too high"" and ""statin"" noises at me.  I'd recently read a study on intermittent fasting so I thought I'd go that route - I've been overweight or borderline almost my entire life and I knew there was no way I was going to be able to stay on a caloric restriction diet for more than 6 months, if that.

To my surprise it turned out to be dead easy to maintain, when fasting I just don't get hungry after 10:30AM of the first day so thats what I did - without ANY change on my diet.

And it worked!  My glucose fasting levels went down to 90ish, triglicerides and hdl/ldl levels down to normal (albeit high normal) and most importantly to me I stopped gaining weight.  Didnt lose much but hey, I'll take the win.

And I went on with my life confident that all I had to do was fasting without any other change.

10 years roll by and I notice I'm notice I'm getting temporary mild headaches when I eat something with a lot of carbs like a mega muffin.  It took me a LONG time to correlate the headaches with eating carbs.

Doc orders tests, fasting glucose is at 105, triglicerides, etc are a little better but pretty much the same.  Doc says ""you're normal, thats what the normal fasting glucose level is somebody with a BMI of 30""  I ask about the carb headaches, he says ""Thats normal too""

I then proceed to pester the HELL out of him until he orders a fasting insulin test.

Well, crap.  Its 12.4 - absolute max normal is 10, desired is less than 7, most non diabetics hover around 5 or less.  Usually a lot less.

More tests, and I'm fairly insulin resistant.  I can make enough insulin to keep my glucose mostly under control unless I really whack it hard (mega muffin).  I'm not a diabetic, or even technically a prediabetic.  But I will be one pretty stinking soon if I don't do something.

Nutritionist says its probably because 80% of my diet was processed food.  Wife and I just don't cook so almost everything is out of a box or premade or heat-up in the microwave.

Doc says &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re normal, thats what the normal fasting glucose level is somebody with a BMI of 30&amp;quot;  I ask about the carb headaches, he says &amp;quot;Thats normal too&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then proceed to pester the HELL out of him until he orders a fasting insulin test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, crap.  Its 12.4 - absolute max normal is 10, desired is less than 7, most non diabetics hover around 5 or less.  Usually a lot less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More tests, and I&amp;#39;m fairly insulin resistant.  I can make enough insulin to keep my glucose mostly under control unless I really whack it hard (mega muffin).  I&amp;#39;m not a diabetic, or even technically a prediabetic.  But I will be one pretty stinking soon if I don&amp;#39;t do something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutritionist says its probably because 80% of my diet was processed food.  Wife and I just don&amp;#39;t cook so almost everything is out of a box or premade or heat-up in the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello keto lifestyle...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, boogers.  At least I&amp;#39;m dumping weight like mad.&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"I have now completed eight weeks of dieting with a fair amount of success, and as I track rather a lot of things during the diet I can show some data on the method and effects the diet has had.

I’m Male, 48 years old, 194 cm, starting weight 122 kg (269 lbs), current weight 106.9 kg (235.7 lbs) which is a loss of 15.1kg (33.3 lbs).

In the first four weeks I reported 9.9kg / 21.8 lbs reduction. So in the second month I have reduced by a further 5.2kg / 11.5 lbs.

My diet consists almost entirely of whole foods. I have a target daily carb limit of 20 net (which I typically exceed slightly). I have no dietary restrictions, allergies etc. I avoid seed oils by choice.

I’m in good health with no diagnosed ailments and I exercise regularly (a few hours per week).

Most days I’m OMAD with a fasting duration between 15 and 28 hours. Some days I have a snack midday and then an evening meal. I never eat more than twice in a day.

Weekly totals of Calories, Macros, Minerals and Exercise are shown in this table: [https://imgur.com/XMSeVdc](https://imgur.com/XMSeVdc)

Over the last four weeks of the diet I have consumed 949g of carbohydrate gross. Nett Carbs would be about 25% less at 660g. A categorisation of the carbs is shown here: [https://imgur.com/p3STzkt](https://imgur.com/p3STzkt)

With all of that being said, here are the gains made over the eight weeks:

• 15.1kg / 33.3lbs total reduction in weight.

• Body measurements greatly reduced: [https://imgur.com/ypyPyHN](https://imgur.com/ypyPyHN)

• BMI reduced from 31.9 to 28.0 (-3.9).

• Body fat reduced by 6.3%. Muscle Mass increased by 3.4%: [https://imgur.com/eqWii1K](https://imgur.com/eqWii1K)

• Visceral Fat score reduced from 14 to 10 (9 is considered healthy).

• Blood Pressure reduced from Pre Hypertensive 133/77 to an Ideal 107/63. Resting Pulse reduced from 65 to 55 (avg): [https://imgur.com/qyPPlMz](https://imgur.com/qyPPlMz)

• Blood Glucose reduced from 9.6 to 6.5 (can't mention the unit as reddit will auto delete the post!)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my total exercise in calories burned and type sorted by week, as you can see the most recent week has been a very significant increase and I put this additional capacity down to becoming properly adapted to ketosis, and becoming progressively fitter.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Other non-scale wins across the duration of the diet would be:

•	Acid reflux went away within 36 hours of starting the diet.

•	I’m fitter as a result of the exercise and I’m getting a lot more sun thanks to the cycling. I was exercising moderately while not doing keto and still gaining weight.

•	One bowel movement per day is a real time saver.

•	Before starting the diet I was experiencing very low energy, this is now no longer a problem.

•	Sleep quality is excellent and snoring has reduced hugely, but it’s still there on occasion.

•	Hunger is completely under control.

•	Various inflamed / sore areas such a ribs and elbows have been greatly alleviated.

•	Mood is very much improved. Mental clarity is sharper and clearer.

My wife and I love Keto and have managed this diet (with IF and of course CICO) many times, and had amazing results. We are huge advocates and recommend it to friends and family, specifically to help lose weight.

We also love to entertain and throw parties, where people let loose and drink alcohol. We do the same, but with 0 carb seltzers/""beers"", or mixed drinks with Coke Zero and 40% Rum/Whiskey/Vodka.*We specifically track everything in MyFitnessPal to ensure we don't overdo carbs.*

The issue is the next day, the hangovers are often BRUTAL - we try to mitigate by chugging water before going to bed, but it doesn't always work.


.


My questions:

**1. Is it possible we are breaking keto somehow, by drinking too much 80 proof spirits and carb free alcohol mixed drinks?**

**2. Will the body convert alcohol into carbs/ stop producing ketones and being fat adapted if you drink too much?**

**3. Should we be calculating alcohol as net carbs?**

Positive side effects so far besides weight and blood sugar:

I sleep less, down from needing 9 hours to function to 6 hours

I feel so much more awake during the day, more productive, more energetic, more focus

Poop way less, keto (and probiotics) took me from sometimes 5 times a day to basically once every 18 hours, stomach pain is gone 

Don't crave water and don't have to pee constantly, I was drinking maybe 2-3 gallons a day and peeing hourly (and waking up to pee) now I'm at like 1.5 gallons a day and pee like a normal person

Occasional blurry vision is gone

Occasional limp numbness is gone

Skin is clearing up

Higher sex drive

Resting heart rate has lowered

I don't eat out any more


Negative side effects so far:

I miss bread, potatos, corn, oatmeal, sugar, etc. 

I'll likely have to buy new clothes soon

More energy means I'm less sedentary and I don't think my joints are used to that yet

Good quality meat and cheese is more expensive than the usual food I've been eating

Pooping is more difficult and takes longer

Occasional heart burn, which is very new to me

I get weird looks when I eat a meal of nothing but meat and cheese at work

,keto,"Man, I am so thankful that I found the DIY ketochow recipe. I have wanted to try ketochow for a while, but due to where I live, shipping costs were quite prohibitive. 

Ordered up all the supplies I need and mixed up 2 weeks of powder. Been drinking it for 1 week now.  Doing well. I was already keto for about a month, but wanted to get a bit more serious with more control over numbers.

Since I started keto about 5 weeks ago, I am down 9kgs and feeling pretty good. This is my 2nd run at keto, previously I did keto for a year and lost 30 or 35kgs. Then some crap happened and life got in the way. I decided to start again because of the benefits.

Not only do I feel better, but while keto my asthma goes away. I have been on steroidal inhalers since 2013 and regular inhalers since elementary school. But while keto, I can stop my meds and have no breathing problems. It's such a life changer.

My plan is to continue exclusively drinking ketochow for at least another week and reevaluate. After that, if I decide to reintroduce food, it will be mostly on weekends. I am quite busy at work so ketochow for lunch and dinners on work days is just a lifesend. 

I do want to reintroduce food on the weekends mostly because I do love cooking. So I want to get back into cooking healthy keto friendly foods as well as fermentation.

I have wanted to try ketochow for a while, but due to where I live, shipping costs were quite prohibitive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ordered up all the supplies I need and mixed up 2 weeks of powder. Been drinking it for 1 week now.  Doing well. I was already keto for about a month, but wanted to get a bit more serious with more control over numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started keto about 5 weeks ago, I am down 9kgs and feeling pretty good. This is my 2nd run at keto, previously I did keto for a year and lost 30 or 35kgs. Then some crap happened and life got in the way. I decided to start again because of the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only do I feel better, but while keto my asthma goes away. I have been on steroidal inhalers since 2013 and regular inhalers since elementary school. But while keto, I can stop my meds and have no breathing problems. It&amp;#39;s such a life changer.&lt;/p&gt;

Usually it’s so uncomfortable that I end up eating carbs and drinking loads of water just before bed, or when I wake up in the night, just to get me out of this state and to not be hungover, but this is less then optimal because it means I need to get into ketosis again every morning.

Over the course of 4 years I’ve put on about 15lbs and am wanting to nip it in the butt before it gets worse.

While this sounds amazing, I did an InBody scan and learned that I’ve actually put on roughly 2% body fat since starting and have also decreased in muscle mass. 

While doing the egg fast I have also incorporated 20 minutes of StairMaster followed by about 40 minutes of lifting weights. I had started this about 2 weeks before my egg fast and have continued to do the same regimen while on my egg fast.

,keto,"Hello, first let me start of saying that I know my first week/first drastic amount of weight loss is water weight.

I’ve been measuring and keeping track of everything I’m consuming and weight myself every so often. I’m currently at 29 days of Keto.

Starting weight: 207lbs.
Current weight: 188.2lbs.

My first week I lost an estimate of 10lbs and I know that it was all of likely because of water weight. After that, I stagnated around the ~198lbs range for week two.

Then on the third week I dropped down to 192-194lbs. Finally, as I’m currently finishing up my fourth week after tomorrow, I weigh myself at 188-189lbs.

I’m worried I may be doing something wrong or unhealthy and want to make sure I’m doing everything safe and correct.

I use the MFP app to track my weight and daily food intake daily. On average I eat about 1500 calories, less than 20g of TOTAL Carbs, ~100g of fat, and ~120g of protein.

Honestly, I quite rarely work out due to my work schedule. But when I do, I swim for about 1-2hours or do weight lifting. I work behind a computer daily so not much exercise there naturally.

I’ve also been struggling with my bowel movements. Today I started taking magnesium, zinc, and psyllium seed husk supplements. 

I’ve been drinking 1-2 gallons of water a day. I believe I’m not intaking enough electrolytes.

,keto,"Okay, I've been around Reddit for a decade. Finally joined 7 years ago- have so much anxiety about posting that I only have 70 karma. I'd promise I'm not a troll, but isn't that what trolls do? Anxiety be damned the results I'm seeing from keto are so life changing that I feel compelled to post if it helps another person in my position. (This is not medical advice, I'm not a doctor, common sense rules and of course you should be in charge of your medical care and work with your medical team.)


I'm a 39 year old mom of 4- 2 of my children have special needs. I have narcolepsy, EDS, POTS, IBS, Lipedema, MCAS, and a slew of other autoimmune issues. My energy is so low- my cortisol sky high, I was getting insulin resistent. After trying traditional meds to ""fix"" problems and not having success, but having more health problems develop I turned to more natural methods over the years. I have a lot of supplements, tried all organic, plant based, AIP, so many different diets. My BMR was so low. I was eating 1100 calories a day and gaining weight- I got up to 205 lbs on a 5'6"" frame. I still go to my primary care doctor who has been supportive of more natural remedies. I haven't bridged the keto subject with him, but I think the results will speak for themselves. 


With all the reading I did on my health problems there were signs pointing to keto. They didn't come from mainstream medicine, but keto kept coming up. I tried once about 5 years ago, but didn't make it through the ""keto flu"" period.  I couldn't function and had too many demands on my time to keep up with my kids/work etc... This time before trying I found the group here and did a lot of reading. I learned that ""keto flu"" is an electrolyte imbalance. Due to POTS I have tons of electrolyte options and salt tablets on hand. Reading so many experiences and tips from real people gave me the motivation to try again.  


I bought the ""pee sticks"" even though I know they're not the end all be all, they let me know my body was doing something besides feeling worse. After a few days I learned to manage my electrolytes better. Now I can address it before it gets bad.  


In the 7 weeks that I've been in ketosis I've lost nearly 20 lbs. That is a huge win for me. I know a lot of it was water weight because I'd always go up and down the same 6-8 lbs. every couple of days. It's staying off now, and I can see the swelling, inflammation, and now fat starting to melt away. As a vain person that is a huge win, but the increases in my health are the real story.



After the first couple of weeks I have been able to go through most days without laying down to rest. I haven't thrown up once from chronic pain. The pain levels are down 40%. I'm hoping to see an improvement in sleep soon. The brain fog is lighter. I'm still not a ""normal healthy"" person, but I can't expect to undo nearly 4 decades in a few weeks.  


Possible TMI, but for the first time in a decade I haven't been dealing with IBS issues. Having regular solid stools is something I never expected. There have been a couple of days where I've eaten something that's thrown me back into it- now I'm learning things to avoid, as opposed to that being my norm.  


It is amazing to not be hungry all of the time. My sleep doctor told me that due to narcolepsy, and because the part of the brain that craves sleep and the part that craves food are so close together, it's normal to constantly feel hungry with my disorder. It was somewhat true- I'd feel hungry, but also nauseated most of the time, and a lot of the time I felt worse after eating. Now eating is in the background. There is no panic feeling about finding something to eat and hoping it doesn't make me feel worse.  


I'm probably still doing ""dirty keto."" I haven't tracked everything and am using allulose, and monkfruit sweetener in things I bake. I still have a hard time eating a lot of meat, but for now nuts, cheese, and when I feel like eating meat, are doing a great job providing satiation. I'll often have a homemade creme brulée for breakfast- with berries for the topping. So it's heavy cream, egg yolk, a little allulose, and the berries. I eat until I'm full- sometimes it's just a few bites, sometimes all of it. I make almond flour/peanut butter/dutch pressed cocoa powder cookies, and almond flour cheese crackers for a quick snack. Lunch is often a salad with cheese, and a full fat dressing. I add meat in if it sounds good. It's amazing how little sweetener it takes for things to taste ""sweet"" now. I aim for 20-25 net carbs a day. Most days I'm not hungry for dinner. If I am I eat something that fits. I pretty much grain free at this point, but it wasn't even a goal when I started. I can tell if something I eat makes me feel yucky now, and it's easy to avoid it without feeling like I'm depriving myself.  


If/when I plateau or feel poorly I'll track and adapt. The beautiful thing is that I feel my energy and mental clarity getting to place where I'm capable of doing that.   


Food is beyond secondary to living now. When I feel hunger- real hunger I'll eat something. There is no need to clean my plate, my body tells me when it is full.   


 I thought I'd never feel well again. I have hope now. I also am excited to see the changes that this diet can have for my kids. The brain and body need fat and protein.  


I was so scared of eating fat. I always thought, ""I am fat, I can't eat fat! Everyone says how bad fat is!"" Don't let the fear hold you back. I know it is so hard to look at changing your diet when you have no energy and constant brain fog- you don't have to make it too complicated. You deserve to feel better.

,keto,"So this keto journey is the third time I've been successful at burning my body fat since I put it on postpartum a decade ago. There was water fasting for about 20 days in 2016, and low carb with IF for about 11 weeks last year. Both of those times I burned body fat and maybe liver fat as I'm doing now, but of course neither of them were as sustainable for me as keto is proving to be.

Other answers on Google suggest poor circulation but I walk 15 to 20 miles a week so I don't think it would be that.

Started keto for the first time ever in November. Told myself I would be on it for one year to get to a comfortable weight. I’ve learned so much about nutrition, that has been a huge win.

BUT… this past March, I was invited on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to France. Two weeks. I decided that I would go to low carb/‘normal’ for the trip and get back on keto when I got home. (I’m glad I did… France was delicious but so not keto friendly LOL).

Got back end of March and I’m having the hardest time going more than a week without screwing up, giving in to cravings, and the scale hasn’t changed. I was lucky in that I was dropping weight at a reasonable speed without exercise. I’ve started adding daily 20-30 minutes of work this week but the cravings are killing me.

&lt;p&gt;Tips? Advice? Cheat codes? 😅 what do you do to get back on track. Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"Hello everyone! 

I've tried keto before and it didn't work for me. I have high sensitivity to fat rich foods, so I was nauseous all day, the whole time I was on a keto diet. I lost a lot of weight in 2.5 months (combined with light exercise) but eventually I just gave up cause I was miserable.

Fast forward 4 years and here I am wanting to get pregnant, but also at my heaviest weight ever. I'm 35, 5'9 (175cm) tall and currently 120kg. I need to lose about 30-40kg because I'm unhappy AF and I also want to give my body a better chance at having a ""normal"" pregnancy. Also I'd prefer to not have all the health issues associated with long term obesity when I'm older. (I've been overweight since I was 14yo).

I occasionally eat fish and chicken, but that's it and I remember not being able to eat meat at all when I did keto 4 years ago from being nauseous all the time. Any meat just smelled and tasted rotten all the time I was on keto, which I figure is cause I was always so nauseous.

I don't know if it's even worth trying keto again, but before I make a decision I wanted to hear from people who aren't big meat eaters either (and somewhat lactose intolerant, forgot to mention that) how do you manage? What is your main source of protein? Also, any tips for feeling less nauseous while eating such a high fat diet?

First post, second day back on Keto
Back story, I did keto in 2018 with great success. 
Then life hit me... Dad died in 2019, pandemic and overall sadness that set in for a LONG time.  
Gained a good amount of weight.
I finally feel whole again, and I've been going to the gym regularly for 5 months, but the scale is not moving. 
I eat healthy, but am over 40 and things just don't work the way they used to... ugh
The major issue I'm facing besides weight is foot pain. It comes and goes, I'm pretty sure it is Plantar F..? I can't spell it sorry.
It hasn't stopped the work outs but the foot pain has been going on 6 month plus, and like I said comes and goes (I am waiting to see a doctor...) 
Until then I am really hopeful keto might help...
Anyone deal with any pain in joints that went away?
And how long would you estimate?

,keto,"A couple of posts recently about people's experiences with doctors who ""get"" keto (and my own recent experiences with a couple of doctors who definitely *do not* ""get"" keto) have got me thinking about the search for a more informed doctor. That search isn't working so well for me (more on that below), but I thought I'd share what I found in case it helped anyone else.

For anyone else in my situation, I found a listing of around 20 different directories for low-carb doctors: [https://metabolicmultiplier.org/keto-doctors-near-me/](https://metabolicmultiplier.org/keto-doctors-near-me/) There are the usual suspects on there like the Diet Doctor search, and some more obscure ones. I obviously can't vouch for any of the sites or the doctors listed on them, but if you want to check your area for a new doc who might be more supportive and don't know where to start, maybe there will be something there to help.

As for me, I'm in Ontario and am starting to suspect that doctors here don't want to rock the boat of our government-provided health care (OHIP) scheme's official SAD guidelines for diets or something. The only doctors I can find in my area on any of the lists (or on Google, for that matter) are specialists, naturopaths, dieticians, etc. I'd just like a new family doctor. Any Torontonians with a decent family doc got any tips on how to locate one? Mine's...mediocre.

,keto,"Long post ahead. TL;DR: my A1C has dropped from 10.8 to 5.9 after 3 months of low carb/Keto. 

Just a little background, I was hospitalized for a pulmonary embolism back in February (the result of Long Covid) and while I was in the ICU, they asked me how long I'd been an uncontrolled diabetic. I'd had blood tests done about 2 years ago and no signs of diabetes were detected, but while in the hospital my A1C tested at 10.8, which is really bad, apparently. While in the hospital, they started me on daily pills and 4x daily insulin injections, and sent me home with a prescription for both, along with a blood testing meter with just a few test strips and lancets. They really emphasized that it was crucial that I continued both medications indefinitely. 

Well, my medical insurance sucks, and when I went to the pharmacy to fill the prescriptions, they told me that they no longer accepted my health insurance. I didn't have a primary care doctor, and the pharmacy that was supposed to fill my prescriptions refused to send them to a different pharmacy to get filled because they wanted to get paid for the prescriptions that they had already prepared. I got caught in an endless bureaucratic mess of the hospital telling me to see my non-existent primary care doctor, the pharmacy sitting on my prescriptions, my insurance provider arguing with both, and was basically screwed when it came to getting the medication I needed. I was getting pretty desperate, so I Googled ""type 2 diabetes how to control blood sugar without meds"" and saw a number of articles saying that a low-carb diet would work. I'd done Atkins back in the 90's, and pretty much remembered that you were supposed to stay under 20 grams net carbs, so I started doing that. 

A couple weeks after getting out of the hospital and starting Atkins, I finally got a ""new patient"" appointment to get a primary care doctor. I explained what I had been dealing with, and that I'd started a low carb diet because I couldn't fill my prescriptions. The new doctor gave me some lancets and test strips for my meter, and had me check my blood sugar right there on the spot. It was just over 100, which was well below the level that indicated I needed an insulin injection, so he told me to monitor it for a few days. He said anything below 180 meant I didn't need insulin, and he wanted to see how my efforts at controlling my blood sugar with dietary changes were going. After a few days of blood sugar tests, he put me on a daily pill and said I didn't need the insulin as long as I stayed on the low carb diet. 

About a month later, my blood sugar levels were dropping down below 80 pretty routinely, so he took me off the daily pills. I found this Keto subreddit, and it looked like Keto was basically Atkins with calorie counting and a few other things added in. I started following along to see what had changed since the mid 90's when I'd done Atkins, and started keeping track of the calories I ate, in addition to tracking my net carbs.

Yesterday marked 3 months since I'd started seeing my new doctor, and he had me go in for an A1C test. This morning, I got a call from the doctor's office asking me to come in for another blood test, because they had made a mistake on one of the tests yesterday. I got to the office and they said they needed to redo the A1C test because they had an ""erroneous result"", so they re-tested it and got the same result again. My A1C has dropped from a 10.8 to a 5.9! I was only on the pills for less than a month before they took me off them, and they couldn't believe the improvement in 3 months, hence why they decided to redo the test.

I was off work for almost a year because of Long Covid (I was unlucky enough to catch it twice, back-to-back) and had gained a bunch of weight from being so sedentary. So far, I've dropped about 60 lbs, and have been maintaining about a 1,000 to 1,400 calorie deficit on most days (based on the maintenance calorie calculator that the Mayo Clinic has online) without really trying very hard to limit my calorie intake. I'm probably kinda lucky in that regard, because I'm 6'6"" tall and weigh a lot, so my ""maintenance calories"" number is over 3000. Makes it easier to stay in a deficit! I'm on serious doses of blood thinners and anticoagulants due to the pulmonary embolism and the fact that there are still a bunch of blood clots in my body, so the doctor has me pretty limited on exercise for now because they don't want me injuring myself or knocking any more clots loose, so I've done this all strictly with diet, very little exercise.

Doing a little experimentation to see how things affect me. Has anyone else experienced similar issues and if so, did it eventually get to where you were more tolerant of fatty meats and such?

I've been wandering something. Is it the state of ketosis that brings all these health benefits people talk about, or is it the low sugar/carbs?

I think, in a sense, it goes hand in hand, but I'm still very curious.

When people talk about the mental of physical benefits they experience, it it the ketones doing this, or is it simply because they've most likely stopped eating bad foods? Maybe both?

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been using Olive and Coconut oil every day and now I am wanting to buy a few more oils so that I can never use the same oil two days in a row. Same with fruits. It&amp;#39;s pretty easy with spices. Got some more of those today too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this how y&amp;#39;all find it works for y&amp;#39;all as well? Is there anyone who always alternates/switches veggies/fruits so that they&amp;#39;re eating different kinds every single day? And does this give you more benefits for your health?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not really the lack of excitement from the same taste. Although that may be a factor. Just the feeling of how healthy it feels for me.&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"I just have to say: I am as happy as a pig in sht right now. In fact it should be illegal to be this happy!

After putting up with a vegan dr for several yrs who pushes Esselstyn/Forks Over Knives and was focusing solely on ways to make my bloodwork look like lowcarb/keto was bad, I did my research and found a great lowcarb dr near me!

He is really great, down to earth, and his family is from where I grew up!

He does low carb himself and tries natural remedies before going the drug route...something else I wanted in a dr.

I am so glad you guys urged me to shop around for a new doctor!🥰

I told him my story: 6 yrs ago was a 370 lb vegan dying of severe sleep apnea, CPAP changed my appetite away from ultra-processed foods/ sugars/other starches, lost 200 lbs,  that led me to Google what a diet like that would be called, and I found both paleo and keto which led me down other rabbit holes too since then, via health documentaries about seed oils, grassfed beef, regen farming, etc.

He said he agrees with me 100% on low carb etc.

He is also clever...I told him my blood pressure tends to be high when I see new drs bc of the whitecoat factor. He brushed it off and started asking where I grew up. Turns out we're both from the same neighborhood but different generations. The convo kept going, I felt very relaxed...he then took my BP and it was fine! Sneaky of him!😁

He looked at my bloodwork reports from a couple months ago from the other dr.Said everything looks great, no more type 2 diabetes, no more fatty liver, everything is fine. He did say my total chol is a little over 200 but ""we'll just keep an eye on it"".

&lt;p&gt;I told him my story: 6 yrs ago was a 370 lb vegan dying of severe sleep apnea, CPAP changed my appetite away from ultra-processed foods/ sugars/other starches, lost 200 lbs,  that led me to Google what a diet like that would be called, and I found both paleo and keto which led me down other rabbit holes too since then, via health documentaries about seed oils, grassfed beef, regen farming, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said he agrees with me 100% on low carb etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is also clever...I told him my blood pressure tends to be high when I see new drs bc of the whitecoat factor. He brushed it off and started asking where I grew up. Turns out we&amp;#39;re both from the same neighborhood but different generations. The convo kept going, I felt very relaxed...he then took my BP and it was fine! Sneaky of him!😁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked at my bloodwork reports from a couple months ago from the other dr.Said everything looks great, no more type 2 diabetes, no more fatty liver, everything is fine. He did say my total chol is a little over 200 but &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;ll just keep an eye on it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s just a 10 min bus ride from my house too!&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"I wanted to post some numbers from my blood test for anyone interested to see what the results were before starting keto and after being on keto.

Some background:  prior to keto, I was on a very poor working mans diet.  Fast food, microwavable meals, pastas, breads, snacks, sweets, etc., etc., with the occasional home cooked meal.

On keto I mainly concentrate on animal proteins and fats with occasional vegetables or fruits.  I do not eat any ""keto"" products, just real whole foods.  I rarely have cheat days.  (mothers day was an exception)  I eat all parts of an animal to get all the nutritional benefits.  Any cut of meat, skin, organs meats and animal fat, etc.  I find this to be a great balance and makes me feel better than just sticking with a few cuts of meat.  No supplements, electrolytes, etc.

I do not measure or count anything.  I do not have a weight scale.  I go by what my body feels it needs.  I find that I will crave a specific meal, like liver or heart and I make sure I satisfy this craving in the following meals.  I understand this is different than some people as they measure and calculate everything, but this works for me.  I only eat when I am hungry.  A few times, this means I fast for a period of 24+ hours and occasionally, I have three meals in one day.  I do not schedule any meals.  Once, I woke up at 0300 because I was craving eggs, so I made eggs.  Work does skew this a bit but adding a few hours to the fast isn't an issue for me.  I drink some water and it keeps me going until I can have a meal.

,keto,"I was looking around on Amazon Prime for something to watch, and found this movie from 1997 with actress Meryl Streep.

Its excellent! Its about a mom whose son developed grand mal epilepsy and they almost lose their home due to the massive med and drug bills even though none of it helped.

Finally out of desperation she researches and learns of the ketogenic diet.  She takes her son to Johns Hopkins and the keto diet cures his epilepsy.

I researched and found this film is based on a true story!

I have been keto-ish since 2017 when my sleep apnea was treated with CPAP, and my own brain ""told"" me to eat this way. My sleep dr said he expected that to happen, bc sleep apnea disorders the appetite hormones ghrelin and leptin giving ppl abnormalcravings for sugar/carbs.

The keto dr in the film said they routinely fast patients for 24-48 hrs before starting keto bc ""fasting rests the body"". 

I remember that after 1 night on CPAP, the usually ravenous appetite I would wake up with was gone. I actually didn't eat anything till the next day, and all I wanted was eggs and beef, 2 foods I didn't eat bc I was a vegan.

But I think my brain, now that it was getting the oxygen it needed, knew what to make me do: fast for a day to rest, then start natural, nutrient-dense whole full fat foods.

Back in 1985 an epileptic  co-worker at the animal shelter where we worked noticed I had staring spells that lasted a minute or so. She urged me to see a neurologist bc she thought I had absence (petit mal) seizures.

I went and got an EEG. Turned out she was right. Dr was going to write me an Rx for a drug but I asked him if there was a natural remedy. He said, ""A high fat diet"". I recoiled in horror bc this was during the lowfat era, my mom raised me lowfat, plus I was still a vegetarian then.

,keto,"Hi all

Been at Keto now for about 5 months. Quick history. I did AIP diet before this to help with mental health issues and weight loss issues. They both went down on the diet, so I thought maybe Keto is the next step.

Keto was an adjustment even though my carbs were already fairly low at about 50-70 per day. It was a real mixed bag. I had some real hard times sleeping when adapting. Learning  new recipes was tricky. I also found for some reason over the beginning I was not getting the energy I had heard about. However my mental health anxiety symptoms were remaining low. Over about 3 months of keto my weight stayed still. So it felt like a holding pattern. I was considering quitting, but I also had read sometimes these improvements can take 6 months - year.

A nice boost was my bloodwork, which looked much better than my last test. Especially testosterone, which was low normal before and now is high normal! Best result in 3 years. Even my cholesterol levels were fine.  That was encouraging. So I began to tinker a bit more.

Biggest thing I tried, and this is a god given gift, was to reintroduce coffee. When my anxiety began 4 years ago, Coffee was a no-no. I could not handle it, my symptoms would go too high. I haven't really drank coffee in years. So i tried a keto coffee with coconut oil (Bulletproof style). The last two weeks my energy has gone way up in a good way. I'm drinking coffee every morning, just a cup or 2.  My mood has improved, libido is better, and less hunger! I went almost 18 hours without even thinking of food. And now my weight loss has continued again, about 3 pounds lost this last month. My fat mass is decreasing and muscle mass is going up. I think 6 more months of this will create a real solid improvement.

I can't say how happy I am about this small thing, I love coffee. I have missed it so much, now I'm drinking it again. And my weight is dropping. I haven't been this light in 5 years. I feel I've got over a big plateau. I think Keto may have helped me enough to handle it again. 

My biggest mental health improvement in the last 5 months is less nightmares. I used to have them every night about a year ago. Now they seem to have stopped.(?) Now if only I could get rid of the mild brain fog I have.

I am an N=1. But for me, I've tried alot of stuff these past 4 years to improve my health. Is keto helping? I'm pretty close to giving it an official stamp of approval for me. I'm going to do another set of blood tests end of the month. But right now I'm encouraged again! Another small improvement have come from adding shirataki noodles (low cal easy snack).  Probably at least 3-6 months more before I consider changing anything.

&lt;p&gt;Been at Keto now for about 5 months. Quick history. I did AIP diet before this to help with mental health issues and weight loss issues. They both went down on the diet, so I thought maybe Keto is the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keto was an adjustment even though my carbs were already fairly low at about 50-70 per day. It was a real mixed bag. I had some real hard times sleeping when adapting. Learning  new recipes was tricky. I also found for some reason over the beginning I was not getting the energy I had heard about. However my mental health anxiety symptoms were remaining low. Over about 3 months of keto my weight stayed still. So it felt like a holding pattern. I was considering quitting, but I also had read sometimes these improvements can take 6 months - year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice boost was my bloodwork, which looked much better than my last test. Especially testosterone, which was low normal before and now is high normal! Best result in 3 years. Even my cholesterol levels were fine.  That was encouraging. So I began to tinker a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biggest thing I tried, and this is a god given gift, was to reintroduce coffee. When my anxiety began 4 years ago, Coffee was a no-no. I could not handle it, my symptoms would go too high. I haven&amp;#39;t really drank coffee in years. So i tried a keto coffee with coconut oil (Bulletproof style). The last two weeks my energy has gone way up in a good way.

I have been trying to eat healthy. As a part of that, I thought of including organ meats in my diet. I ate chicken liver (organic) cooked with ghee, onions, garlic and tomato. I added a few seasonings too. I do eat all this regularly except chicken liver here.

However, my face (chin and forehead) got these tiny red blemishes which got bigger after a couple of days. Now, it looks like spreading everywhere.

,keto,"Hi all, I posted a few weeks ago asking if anyone had any experience with keto and benzo withdrawal (was prescribed a high dose and then left on it for about 18 months despite trying to get help reducing). Have flagged this nsfw because drugs I guess? 

Well, I’m now nearly 4 weeks into keto and wanted to report the findings of my n=1 experiment. 

Firstly, keto has greatly improved how I feel when I reduce my benzo dose. Rather than feeling terrible for 5-6 days after a reduction, I just feel a bit ‘off’ for 3-4 days. This was the main thing I wanted to try keto for, with the thinking that it seems keto can increase GABA production in the gut, and benzo use makes GABA receptors ‘lazy’. So far so good with the reductions! Only 3 more months to go…

Generally speaking my mood is a bit more level, but not massively improved. However I have an ‘interesting’ psychiatric history so definitely didn’t expect it to fix all my problems!!!

I’ve lost weight, roughly 14lbs/6.5kg. I thought this might happen but it’s not really a goal for me as I felt ‘ok ish’ where I was. I know a lot of this is water weight. BUT I am now back where I was before taking an antipsychotic regularly last year. It’s something I’ll monitor and probably up the fat, this wasn’t really my goal for keto. 

Didn’t experience keto flu, but was very mindful of electrolytes from the start. 

My rock climbing has improved, I seem to have more stamina and power but this may also be because of weight loss so better power/weight ratio? Haven’t been training like a demon so I’m assuming this is what it is. But fuelling big climbing days feels a lot easier, and the further I get towards keto adaptation, the easier it is to top up the energy levels with cheese or macadamias if I’m feeling fancy! 

Way less brain fog, actually starting to be able to work again. Only odd days but that’s a massive improvement. 

Cost wise, I’m surprised that I’m saving money, so that’s awesome. 

So yeah, so far so dreamy! Caveat of sample size of 1…would recommend giving keto a go if you’re trying to withdraw from benzos.

,keto,"Hey, r/keto!  
   
I hope you're all doing well on your keto journeys. I wanted to start a discussion today about a topic that has been on my mind lately: the combination of antidepressants and the keto diet. I believe it's a topic that many of us might be curious about, and sharing our experiences could be helpful for others in similar situations.  
   
Personally, I had followed the ketogenic diet for several months in the past. I have been taking antidepressants for a while. While I've seen positive changes in my mental health, I've often wondered if incorporating keto would make any difference.  
   
So, I'd love to hear from those of you who have experience with both the keto diet and antidepressants. Here are a few questions to kick off the discussion:  
   
1. Have you noticed any specific changes in your mood or mental health since starting the keto diet while taking antidepressants?  
2. Did you experience any side effects from the combination of the two? If so, how did you manage them?  
3. Did you consult with your healthcare provider or nutritionist about combining these two approaches? If yes, what advice did they give you?  
4. Have you found any particular foods or supplements to be beneficial or disadvantageous for maintaining both the ketogenic state and your mental well-being?  
5. Any tips or suggestions for someone who is considering starting the keto diet while taking antidepressants?  
   
Of course, please remember that everyone's experience is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. This discussion is not meant to replace medical advice but rather to share personal anecdotes and insights.  
   
So, if you've followed the keto diet while taking antidepressants, or if you're currently doing so, I'd love to hear your thoughts! Your experiences and insights could be invaluable to others in our community who are considering a similar path.  
   
Let's support each other and foster an open and understanding environment for this discussion. I look forward to hearing from you all!

,keto,"I am down 9 lbs! I'm assuming it's all water weight right now because my body doesn't look \*too\* different, but I cannot be happier with the benefits that I've had the last 4 weeks!

My SW is 133lbs, I don't really have a specific goal weight I'd say, as I'm wanting to lose fat, but gain some weight back in muscle. Once I hit my goal appearance, I'm thinking of doing keto at a maintenance level until early next year (when my LDR boyfriend moves in with me), but I really wouldn't mind doing it for longer. It's been extremely beneficial.

Here are some of my findings in the the first month of doing keto:

1. My love for food and cooking has been reignited. I've been struggling with binge eating/purging and having a terrible relationship with food for the last 4 years. I'm now eating things like chicken wings, chicken thighs, steak, bacon, cheese, chicharron, chicken skin and eggs. I used to eat strictly egg whites and chicken breast when I was doing low carb &amp; low fat. At first, I was honestly really worried about tracking again as it's such a slippery slope for me, but I've been planning out my meals and tracking everything just fine. My mental health surrounding food has been so much better.
2. I've been sleeping like a fricken baby. I fall asleep within minutes of my head hitting the pillow, and I feel so well rested when I wake up.
3. Grocery shopping is way more streamlined. I have my list for the week, I'm in and out, and not spending money on random snacks.
4. My skin looks soooo good because of all the water I'm drinking.
5. Speaking of water, I've never used Mio before since I like good ol' regular water, and I started using the blueberry lemonade Mio for my ketoade. Mio is so good lol 
6. No bloating! I've been sensitive to something when I ate pizza and pasta but only sometimes. Couldn't figure it out. But now it's not an issue.
7. I'm way less hungry and fasting is much easier. I eat between 12:00 pm and \~6:30 pm and I don't often find the need to snack.
8. I'm eating the most whole foods ever in my life.
9. I've never had such a positive and fun outlook on a big lifestyle change.

The cons list is short- my performance at the gym is still hindered and I get hella sugar cravings. I'm still probably not fully fat adapted yet, but I'm patient. And I'm happy with how things are going!

,keto,"RESOLVED: IT WAS THE WHEY PROTEIN POWDER! I’VE REPLACED IT WITH VEGAN PROTEIN POWDER — NO MORE BLOATING! 


I intermittent fast from 8pm at night until 4pm the next day. 

I eat MAINLY whole foods for example: Chicken, beef, tuna, salmon, eggs, spinach, lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, asparagus and etc are my go tos. Of course I switch up the combination weekly. 

I drink 8 glasses of water a day.

I drink zero sugar/carb electrolytes daily. 

I also drink whey protein powder with 6oz of cashew milk. 

Fats that I consume everyday are  avocado oil and half an avocado a day. 

I only eat cheese and milk or cream in moderation. 1-2 weeks without dairy then 1 week consumption. 

If and when I do snack, I eat berries and a bit of non dairy yogurt and add chia seeds or a small bag of Quest protein chips. 

The past 3 weeks, I’ve only had 1 cheat day. Stayed under 100g of carbs. Although I did drink alcohol that day. 

Usually I’ll have 1 cheat day a week. Sometimes every other week or I just detox/eat clean the whole month. 

I eat 1,200 cal a day and stay under 40g of carbs (20 net carbs) and get at least 80g of protein and fat. 

It sucks because I’ve been bloated for 2 weeks. I’ve start taking 60 billion probiotics daily for a whole week so far while fasting but it hasn’t helped at all yet, I’ve been consuming foods with fiber, I’ve tried magnesium and that hasn’t helped. 

Any suggestions of what I could be doing wrong or could change? 

FYI - This question and/or concern is NOT for weight loss! 
Just for bloating. 

Btw I’ve been down 75lbs so far in 7 months!

&lt;p&gt;I intermittent fast from 8pm at night until 4pm the next day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eat MAINLY whole foods for example: Chicken, beef, tuna, salmon, eggs, spinach, lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, asparagus and etc are my go tos. Of course I switch up the combination weekly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drink 8 glasses of water a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drink zero sugar/carb electrolytes daily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also drink whey protein powder with 6oz of cashew milk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fats that I consume everyday are  avocado oil and half an avocado a day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only eat cheese and milk or cream in moderation. 1-2 weeks without dairy then 1 week consumption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If and when I do snack, I eat berries and a bit of non dairy yogurt and add chia seeds or a small bag of Quest protein chips. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past 3 weeks, I’ve only had 1 cheat day. Stayed under 100g of carbs. Although I did drink alcohol that day. &lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"Hey all,

I'm curious about something. I know this is a very serious topic for a lot of people.  In no way am I trying to downplay anything, I'm simply trying to learn. I have a very close relative who struggles with a binge eating disorder, and I'm trying to learn more about how it works mentally.

I often hear people (who have Binge Eating Disorder) going keto or carnivore to try and treat their disorder. I'm just curious how such a thing works? How does going keto help someone with Binge Eating Disorder?

A few more questions I think of are:

1. Does it really 'treat'  the disorder, or does it work as a band-aid?
2. Would you consider going keto for Binge Eating Disorder running away from the problem? or do you have another perspective of this?
3. Is a Binge Eating Disorder curable?
4. People who do keto for binge eating disorder: do you feel like overcoming a binge eating disorder is also possible non keto? What are you perspectives. I'm very keen to hear them.

&amp;#x200B;

What I also hear a lot, is that in order to 'cure'  a binge eating disorder, one has to allow ALL foods, including carbs and sugars. While I think this is true to some extent, I feel the problem lies also within that carbs and sugars are very addictive. So to some extent, it feels almost like saying: to cure alcoholism(or some other drug), you need to include bits of alcohol(or other drugs) in your diet. yet those drugs keep you hooked at the same time. I hope I'm not sounding vague here.

If carbs and sugars keep you hooked and keep you having cravings, can one really 'cure'  a binge eating disorder?

Again, I'm asking in the most respectful way. Just trying to learn.

Thank you very kindly.

I'd like to know if this is just a fear mongering thing or truly a concern?

1.) Malitol has a high glycemic index. I have read there is Malitol syrup and powder and the syrup is the bad one? I assume in a pudding it would be Malitol syrup but the ingredients do not specify. Nor is it specified how much, but it is the *third* ingredient in the list, while sucralose is second to last.

2.) Due to this high glycemic index, our bodies produce insulin. But because Malitol isn't fully absorbed in our body, the insulin 'has nothing to do' which is creating insulin resistance on what should be one of the better diets to fight that specific problem!?

Since having this Malitol ingredient pudding I have noticed I either feel more tired than normal or it's just a coincidence that I'm working harder at work.

The other side of this coin is that according to *some* sites, Malitol won't kick you out of ketosis as long as the net carbs stay in the limit.

I am prescribed medical marijuana for PTSD. I use it a couple of times a week. THE reason I've gained weight after many years of maintaining my loss is the marijuana &amp; uncontrolled munchies. I finally reached a point where I'm like - ok I can't let myself gain any more - I'm just trying to get back down to my maintenance weight.

I'm new to keto - I lost all my weight calorie counting (and then developing an eating disorder. 0/10 do not recommend). I've only vaped twice since starting, but I noticed that the munchies were not NEARLY as bad! Is this anyone else's experience?

Last night, I left myself a couple hundred calories for an evening snack, wound up needing to vape. I had some celery w/ cream cheese dip + a babybel cheese and did not feel hungry or like I couldn't stop. Whereas before I would absolutely slam like 1,000 calories in snacks.

,keto,"Alright. I’ve tried keto before. It was good at first but it went down hill and caused extreme binge eating.

I’m assuming this was due to 

1. Too many sweeteners/keto ice cream/protein bars

2.not eating fiber

3.eating wayyy too much cheese/nuts/calorie dense foods

Other possible factors 
4.electrolytes?
5.Water?

This time I have a plan. Obviously it’s not exact but here it goes

Morning:
-Cup spinach

-100g mushrooms

Some kind of protein/fat to cook with the veggies such as :cheese,salmon patty,eggs 

-1-2 tablespoon chia seeds with cup of cashew milk with 1-3 tsp sugar free sweetener

Lunch: nothing crazy. Just turkey pepperoni or something to snack on.
Maybe 2 if I get hungry. Has lots of sodium

Dinner: I meal prepped a side of veggies and ground beef. If I am still hungry, I will have another one or another pack of pepperoni. But I will not have an extra one of these if I had that other pack of pepperoni from earlier 

After dinner I will have another chia seed drink

This gives me 1200-1800 calories depending. Net carbs for sure under 50 but I’m keeping them under 25 just to be safe.


I will have 1-2 energy drinks as needed, but hopefully will change to coffee

My sodium is enough. Potassium is low so I will supplement potassium and magnesium.

Will try to drink lots of water

The differences I see from doing it this way than previously is:

 the only sweeteners I am having are the energy drinks and a few teaspoons for my chia drink. No keto ice cream or keto chocolate or binge eating quest bars. Maybe gum here and there

I am eating more meat than cheese/nuts and other calorie dense foods. I am kind of over this “stuff yourself with fat” bullshit because very fat dense foods do not make me full. Pepperoni will. Pepperoni has fat but it has more protein than fat. I can’t eat cheese and nuts all day.


I am eating more fiber. Thanks to chia seeds. I am hoping this helps

I forgot how I was doing on water and electrolytes last time I did keto but I don’t think it will be an issue since sodium
Is good and I just have to supplement the other two.

Yes I am eating processed foods but I’m a busy person and i like quick and filling snacks. 

What I remember from when I failed was that I was BINGE EATING cheese and also having Turkey with it. Most of the fiber I got were from protein bars I think. And I would eat keto ice cream and protein bars everyday. At first I did well but idk why eventually I broke.I was always bloated and felt disgusting (also because of sugar alcohols) and was having like 30 pieces of gum. I really hated my life

2 years ago in May I started keto and it changed my life. I always struggled with overeating and binge eating, to the point where I was pre diabetic and in horrible health. Keto most likely saved my life.

Throughout the two years, I’ve eaten around 1600-2200 calories a day and most days less than 20-30 carbs with cheat meals every month or two. That, combined with weightlifting every day got me to the point I am at now. Started at 376lbs, now around 208.

If anybody has any doubts about sticking with it long term, it’s worth it. There’s been points where I was the same weight for 2-3 weeks and it can get discouraging but staying consistent with your calories will 100% get you to where you want to be. Once I hit 200 I’ll be reintroducing carbs to my diet trying to build a new lifestyle, but keto has been an incredible tool and I’m sure I’ll use it in the future. Next step after that is probably loose skin removal but it’s too expensive lol.

If anyone has any questions please ask but I just wanted to share where the diet has enabled me to get to and hopefully motivate some people🙂",t2_6zd9uwvc,False,,0,False,168 lbs lost,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Success Story'}]",r/keto,False,6,success,0,,,False,t3_13x7c9h,False,dark,0.97,,public,744,2,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Success Story,False,744,,False,True,nsfw,1685716415.0,,[],{'gid_3': 1},,True,,1685591278.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.keto,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://yourimageshare.com/ib/ZFLexGFWD4.webp""&gt;Transformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm overweight and doing it to feel better and losing weight is a bonus. I am feeling better without all the inflammation caused by carbs etc, but over the last 2-3 days I've been struggling to eat. Is this bad?
Example, I only managed to eat half of a pork chop last night and 1 asparagus stick and some cheese. No where near hitting any of my macros. Day before I only had a serve of bacon with 2 fried eggs and avocado, then didn't eat until around 30 hours later with the pork chop.

I keep reading different info, some saying it's ok and to not force myself to eat. Only eat when hungry, once in ketosis if you have excess fat stored it will switch to using that rather than depending on your intake. 

Others saying you have to stick to your macros.

Allows for a lot more incidental vegetable carbs, and isn’t enough to “accidentally cheat” — ie, eat my kids pizza crust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems I have a “technical” top, and a “let’s still be at a decent caloric deficit” top.&lt;/p&gt;

This post was mostly to talk about how I'm a little worried about the coming months. I've been living in Mexico for about 2.5 years now, and it has been easy to stick to keto while I'm here (started on November 3rd, 2022). Honestly, I have nothing to do here but concentrate on my diet, my exercise, and my reading (I love reading... I've gone through about 100 books this year alone) but in 3 weeks I'm going back home to the US. I've been accepted into a training program to become a merchant mariner, which is one of the biggest incentives for my weight loss.

I have family here, so I have free rent through family-owned property, and my mom is paying my way.

I guess my worry is going to the merchant mariner's school... you have to live there for a few months, and they feed you all your meals, same thing once I'm on a ship working, you live on the ship while you work, so they feed you. I had been at the school back in 2019, but because of my weight (I was also around 299 then... I think my paperwork says 292 lbs) I didn't make it through the program because I didn't have the stamina or strength to do any of the physical stuff, but now they have taken me back and I'll join classes sometime between August and October. I'm not worried about my physical abilities, I've been exercising with a trainer and cardio on my own, and I know 100% I can do it. What I'm worried about is falling off the train on my diet while I'm there... okay, so deep inside I know I won't. I think the fear is like a phobia, unreasonable, but even though I know that I'm not any less scared... I've been around carbs and sugars with people around me the whole time I've been doing keto, and I've yet to eat anything that would go against that--Except for that time I accidentally eat a stir-fry with a sauce that apparently had sugar in it and I had the worst stomach pains I've had in a while for like 3 days... plus other more embarrassing stomach issues.

I just planned on avoiding the potatoes and corn and getting the garlic butter seasoning. Do you y’all think it’s safe? If i wasn’t so early into Keto I wouldn’t be as worried about it. Thank you for your help!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Release is an all-natural plant based nutraceutical that works to provide the proper nutrients needed to support metabolic efficiency and support your body’s natural lean mass. The proprietary blend of ingredients combined in the Release dietary supplement were selected to help heal metabolic dysfunction by relieving oxidative stress, maintaining a healthy inflammatory response and encouraging proper cellular function by supporting your body’s molecules of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"Hello, my is Joobat and I have some concerns about my current diet.   


I started my keto diet around 1 1/2 months ago and so far I have went from 405 to 380 and im very happy so far with my progress. I understand that it was probably water weight but never the less it feels great to have some progress. Now a little about me, I was told by my doctor that my liver was larger than it should be it was due to the beginning of fatty liver disease so that was the wake up call that made me want to make a change and I heard that the Keto diet is great for this.  


So far the last week or so I have been feeling very tired and like I have no energy. This is similar to when I started keto minus the headaches. As far as I know I have been consistent with my food and have been trying to stay as low on carbs as I can.  I know longer eat out and I try to keep my carbs to 50 a day.

According to myfitnesspal my daily caloric intake should be 2,563 (After calculating deficit) and honestly I eat way less than that. I am starting to think that eating this low under my deficit is starting to affect me because I'm not getting the energy I need.

&amp;#x200B;

My usual food intake is:  


\-7AM--Black coffee or plain green tea  
\-11:30--4 eggs with cheese w/ hot sauce (558 cal)

\-5:30-----&gt;Chicken thighs /w a vegetable and cheese (830 cal)

\*And always as much water as I drink, usually 4-5 bottles of water a day\*

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly with this amount food I feel full and any more than that I would be uncomfortable.   


So the question is am I feeling this way due to my lack of calories and if so what changes can I make to eat a more calorie dense food or perhaps not fast and eat breakfast. Or maybe its a vitamins issue? Im not sure. I hope I can get some assistance with this issue and if you have any questions ill try my best to answer them.",t2_u6ezl,False,,0,False,Keto diet/nutrition help,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Help'}]",r/keto,False,6,SOS,0,,,False,t3_13w7ha5,False,dark,0.67,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Help,False,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1685494040.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.keto,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, my is Joobat and I have some concerns about my current diet.   &lt;/p&gt;

I have had varying degrees of food aversion issues at different times in my life, but when doing strict low carb, I usually would find that, if after a few weeks say, bunless burgers started to gross me out, then I could pivot to wings and or cold cut roll ups or something until the aversion went away.

,keto,"Hi,  
  
I need your advice and wisdom. Please bestow me with your wisdom!  
  
First, for better understanding, here is my UNFINISHED weight loss story.  
  
For further understanding: I'm male, 21 years old, about 1.80 cm.  
  
For a long period of time, to be precise, from September to November and from February till now, I am water fasting 2 - 3 days of a week, the rest of the week I'm doing OMAD Keto.  
  
My week looks like that: Monday till Wednesday I'm fasting, Thursday (Sometimes also late Wednesday) till Sunday I'm eating one meal, which consists of 3–4 eggs made into an omelette, with toppings like mozzarella cheese, goat cheese, butter cheese and some cherry tomatoes, after that meal I eat like 150 - 300gr of berries. Overall it's about 1500 - 1900 calories, it depends on how cheesy I feel like. I forgot to mention that I also use coconut oil for the pan, and I also eat a teaspoon of it. Sometimes I also have guacamole as a dip, I used to use mayo, but I stopped it, because it's not very healthy I guess. What I forgot to mention was, that I also drink lots of zero calories/sugars drinks, like coke zero, zero ice tea etc. What do you think about that?  
  
Firstly, please rate that diet. Any recommendations or suggestions for improvement? Is that like fine?  
  
That diet does work, because in September I weighted 125 kg (my record, unfortunately) I'm now sitting at about 86 kg. So I almost lost 40 kg. My friends, my family, my work colleagues and ofc all the girls which now find me attractive noticed that. Me too. I really slimmed down, I wear L instead of XL now. Most of my clothes are now over-oversized for me. I can clearly see some of my veins on the hands. Overall I look more defined, like my face, you know? It's not that chubby anymore.  
  
BUT I still do not see my abs, I still have some fat around my belly, around my man boobs, around the waist. I'm frustrated, I now want it more than ever. My weight loss also kinda slowed down when I started getting under 90 kg. So I started to pick up the gym again, but tbh I'm questioning the effectiveness and usefulness of that. I'm doing cardio 2x a week, mostly on a treadmill, with 5.5 km/h and an incline of 5 %, and 2x a week I'm doing weight training push-pull split. For legs, I will need to add a third day where I go to the gym. My question is, is weight training effective while I do my diet and being in a constant calorie deficiency. Like, muscles need sufficient nutrients to grow, regrow and repair, right? Also, for my problem with the slow-down of my weight loss, should I just add another 1 or 2 days of fasting to the week. What do you think?

,keto,"Hello,  I started keto in January and have been very happy with my weight loss.  What concerns me is I seem really short on protein and with my already declining muscle mass I don't want things to be worse than they need to be.  When I check the Cronometer last 7 day report, it says I consumed 213gr of protein equal to 17% of my intake, 154gr carb for 12%, and 840gr of fat for 70%.  C calculates that for that week I averaged 54g of protein which was 47% of my target.

I use Keto Calculator and it says while on a 20% reduction my protein should be 116gr.  When I try to find out what to eat to achieve that, I found some info on the Diet Doctor.  The DD says for my height, I should be consuming 130 grams, but I can't even reach 116.  DD says:

100 grams is   
3.5oz of meat, poultry, or fish  
4 large eggs  
3.5oz of nuts/seeds

I am  mostly OMAD.  My dinner last night was 8.5oz of barbecued 80% hamburger after cooking.  Cronometer is only crediting me for 60 gram of protein.  If I believe cronometer, I would need to eat a full pound of hamburger daily to meet my protein requirement, not the 4-5oz DD says?

I also eat nuts....Cronometer says 2oz of almonds is 12g of protein, not 50gr the way DD says.

Since I am using Cronometer to track things I have to live with what it says, but why is Cronometer half the protein that DD says it is?

,keto,"Hello everyone,

I did a keto diet for about three months, and I lost about 25 pounds, which is awesome. I also did intermittent fasting. I want to list the positive and negative parts of the diet that I experienced, and how the past week off from keto was for me, and how I can transition to keto again, but more successively.

Positive aspects:
1) Mental health was much better: Less OCD and anxiety symptoms!
2) Intermittent fasting was much easier.
3) Eating my normal amount of calories to lose weight was much easier.
4) I didn’t experience hunger as often. I felt happy with the amount I was eating, even though I wasn’t necessarily full.
5) My sleep, energy, and motivation was better.

Negative aspects:
1) Cravings for sugar: I had two cheat days in about three months of doing keto, where I had carbs (big mistake). The cravings for sugar have been difficult for me.
2) Diversity of food: I was basically eating two meals, where the first meal was 2 eggs, sausage, cheese, and keto toast, and meal two was usually steak and eggs, or the same as meal one. It was VERY boring. I would also have olive oil, avocado, MCT oil, and electrolytes.
3) Difficulty making keto long-term.
4) I wasn’t having enough protein, which was worrying me, especially since I. Noticed muscle loss.
5) I wasn’t having enough vegetables and fruit.

I took a week off from keto to see if I can transition to a regular diet, and 4 days included eating fast food and dessert. I feel very disappointed for stopping keto, but I want to continue with keto, and fix my previous mistakes, and make this a long-term diet/lifestyle.

TL;DR:  I’m struggling with stagnation 6-months in. Depressed, frustrated, angry at myself.  Wondering why I can’t seem to make progress and how to stick with it in the face of this much frustration. 

Long time lurker (first time posting personal specifics). I know this is going to sound like a b*#chfest,(it probably will be), so thank you in advance for letting me get this out there. 

Now firmly in my 40s, I have struggled with my weight since my teens. Using diet pills, I developing the nickname of “skeletor,” weighing about 110lbs at graduation. I gained weight in college, averaging about 145-150 for most of my 20s-30s. I thought I was unhappy with my body then… but oh boy, we lived through COVID and by the 2022 Holiday season, I weighed over 200 lbs. I was sick and terrified of how to get my life back.

I decided then to commit to low carb, having tried 2-3 week stints at a time off and on for years.  Across the first 6 weeks, I went from 201 to 189 and entered 2023 feeling hopeful.  Then I stagnated at 185+, gaining and losing the same 3-7 lbs repeatedly since January. It was (and is) depressing.

To try and break the plateau, last week I did my first prolonged fast at 96 hours. It was harder than I thought it would be, but the scale moved all the way down to 180.2 and I was ecstatic - thinking I’d cracked the “code” and would start seeing the “woosh” effect.  This morning, it was back to 187.  I realize most of the fasting “loss” was water, etc. but I just feel defeated and could use some words of wisdom from the community. 

To try and answer some questions in advance: 

1) I do not exercise, but regularly get around 5-6k steps per day (I primarily WFH/“office job”, so 10k steps are hard to achieve in my house). I realize this is the likeliest path to “moving the needle” but I’ve never liked working out.  I thought I could use the kitchen to achieve my goals… evidentially not. 

2) After calculating my “sedentary” TDEE, I revised my calorie target down from 1500 to 1300/day in April and consistently meet between 1100-1400, prioritizing protein over fat calories. My biggest challenge is getting enough protein without too much fat (viewing fat as a “hard limit” vice a goal). Through the CarbManager app, daily objectives are: 1288 kcals, 80.5g protein, 100g fat, 16.1 net carbs. 

3) My SO is supportive and I have little trouble creating meals that work for both of us.  I have also have abstained from alcohol all but 3 times since the beginning of May - the longest I’ve gone without drinking since college, so, definitely a NSV, but not my priority. 

4) My internal monologue has been stuck on something from an old “Beachbody” workout video: “if you want something you’ve never had, you have to do something you’ve never done.” For me, I’ve never worked out regularly and haven’t been consistent with my health goals.  So, I know the path is likely in front of me (IF + KCKO + exercise), but waking up early to work out OR working out after a full business day exhausts me just thinking about it. 

5) Today, I am back on a 48-hour fast (ending tomorrow night for a friends birthday dinner) and am going to try a series of rolling fasts and/or 5:2, but have little hope of my ability to sustain long term. 

6) I personally know several people who have had great success on keto - but they are all men.  I know the science doesn’t discriminate - the human machine is the human machine - and as a female, I should be able to achieve similar results as my male friends, but most often it doesn’t feel that way. 

7) I’ve gone back and forth on weighing myself daily vice weekly vice only when I’ve been “good” or “bad” and I don’t know what’s best for me specifically to stay motivated.

I want to be more ingrained into the community and understand why people do this and some of their struggles. 

Why did you choose the keto lifestyle? 

Are there any keto friendly products that you avoid for any reason? (high carbs or bad artificial sweeteners) 

What do you all use for quick meals? (I've been struggling recently with my inability to cook as often due to work and would like some more options.) 

Is there a lack of keto friendly options where you are? Grocery stores and eating out. When I eat out I typically get Chipotle but I would like to know if there's more options out there.

Food: I eat a lot of cheese, bacon, sausages, steak, chicken, tinned tuna, avocado, eggs, ham. I also bought low carb bread/rolls. I often hit 20g carbs but not enough protein or fat.

,keto,"So I’ve had a mixed eating disorder. Started at like 13. Starved my way down 75lbs. Was surprised at how easy it was but maybe it’s because I had such little carbs that food wasn’t an issue. Was only eating like 700 calories a day. Went from 210 to 135

Fast forward, maintained my weight then gained it. Then started working out and toned my body. Then liked my body at this weight (165lbs) with the muscle built but was still wanting to be 145-155 but I just couldn’t! I just stayed in my 160s I never gained the full amount but food was definitely an obsession being managed by cardio and calorie doubting

Then I tried keto. Worked for a month or two and got to 155 but then like this huge rush of binge eating came to me. Like I got so depressed. I would always think of food. I wouldn’t be able to go to sleep without binge eating.
So I stopped keto because I was going up to like 170-180 and really hated my self. Then I saw a psychiatrist and now I am on a medication called vyvanse to manage adhd and BED. I lost all the weight. Now I’m in my 150s which is beautiful for my height!

But I still don’t take vyvanse some days and I wanna try and learn to eat well without vyvanse. Because let me tell you, food SERIOUSLY became an obsession like im talking about u could not do anything without obsessing over food then I would binge then literally wanna kill my self

Here’s what I think I did wrong

-would randomly eat stuff like cheese
-didn’t do meal plans
-ate a lot of sweeteners like
*keto ice cream
*quest bars
*diet soda
*gum
-did not know how to get electrolytes properly
-did not incorporate many fibers / veggies

My plan now, is to have a standard easy to make breakfast or meal prep a week before for breakfast if needed. For lunch just have 2-3 snacks. ANd meal prep all my dinners a week before hand . Incorporate veggies and meats and avoid sweeteners. And find a way to easily get my electrolytes.

Im always lethargic randomly. I HATE being bloated. I hate thinking of food and craving food. I wanna do this the right way. Other questions I have, 

Keto made me constipated. Would a good amount of fiber fix this? Veggies?

How do I EASILY get my electrolytes in? I wanna prep everything and make this as easy as possible.

I don’t want keto to be a complicated thing. I wanna be able to prep everything in a day for every week and get ALL my foods and electrolytes easily just by grabbing it and going

I don’t wanna spend a stupid amount of money. I am willing to prep. Is this realistic?

How much of sweeteners can I have? I am okay with avoiding them but is a diet soda here and there okay?

Does keto really help with energy and productivity? I hate being bloated and I have a hard time focusing
. 

Lastly. Considering all this, should I even try? It did fuck me up last time
I tried it but maybe that’s due to my stupidity. I just want it because I hate being bloated I hate craving shit I hate binge eating and I hate not being energetic. I don’t wanna rely on meds the rest of my life to control my appetite. I also wanna become more productive. I really just wanna have a good life and your diet is a huge part of how you preform. If I eat a lot I literally wanna sleep and do nothing and sometimes just wanna die from guilt and tiredness and bloating. Like it REALLY affects my mood. I wanna do so much. I wanna study, I wanna feel awake , I wanna have a good body, I wanna have a good life, I wanna learn to day trade. I can’t do any of this if I feel like shit because of my physical and mental state of my body. I want self discipline in all areas and it’s literally impossible if I don’t have a good diet.

If you made it thru my post, thank you so much. I just need help. I am a slave to food. I want discipline in all areas of life and I’m sick of living like this

,keto,"After 3 failed attempts at keto, I can finally say that I have a 1 in front of my weight for the first time in over 10 years!!!

I started keto at nearly 260 lbs at 6'0.

My first round of keto got me down to 218 lbs. After my trip to Japan, I stopped dieting and I went right back up to 258 lbs.

Second time around I got down to 208 lbs and felt great to be so close to the hundreds, but I fell off keto, did more traveling, and my weight went right back up to the 250s.

Third time around, I dropped down to 208 **again** (I dubbed it the ""Curse of 208"") for my wedding. Wife and I promised each other to stay on track after the wedding which didn't happen. I went back up to the 230s.

I ate like shit still, but I was starting to bike/cycle a little bit. At first it was just 4-7 miles around the city after work, but then I started upgrading shit on my bike. And then I went sooo far down the rabbit hole with my bike I just got hooked on cycling. Like, really hooked. I love modding and swapping shit out like building PCs, modding my car, so naturally I loved modding and tinkering on my bike.

Anyway, after awhile I finally said, ""What the fuck is the point of cycling and working out if I don't eat right?"" so I started up keto again back in the end of November/early December and got super serious.

I cycle \~75 miles a week now with an average speed of 18 MPH compared to my baby 4 mile rides at 13 MPH. Shedding weight has improved my speed tremendously (obviously). No upgrade on my bike would've helped nearly as much. Looking to average 20 MPH and do a sub 5-hour century ride later this year!

Well, I finally hit 199 this morning and honestly I don't even know what to feel because I didn't think I'd be able to do it. All I know is I'm gonna continue to ride this momentum out. Aiming for 185 for now and gonna go from there!

TLDR: Failed keto 3 times. Got super serious about cycling and eating right and now I'm 199!

,keto,"Hi all, bern doing keto and uf for a year and five months.

Im doing it for a lot of hralth reasons inuding wright loss.

I have hoshimotos. It caused a lot of issues including apparently digestive damage into my lower gi. Think really bad digestive ulcers causing shitting bright red blood for over a month coupled with severe stabbing stomach pain from evem drinking water .

That was over 2 years and 5 months ago, over a year pre keto. Ive been baby stepping chamges for over 2 years with keto and if staring jan lasy year. 

Now, as ive learned ive managed to find some food intolerances and catb intolerances. Ive found minor hiccups here and there and foubd solutions.

In i think august or september last year, i really noticed a ongoing issue with stomach gurgling, bloating, gas, occadional pain, and spray paint poos. Amd i mean spray paint as in supet watery and very forceful evacuation of my colon. 

I couldnt figure out a cause. It wasnt too much magnesoum or too little calcium. It wasnt too much fermented food, it wasnt a electrolyte imbalance or too much or too little fiber, i thought. 

Nothing helped. Then, i ran out of all leafy greens and criciferous veg for a frw days. My dr had been suspecting ibs. But it wasnt the only likely cause. I have no gaulbladder, i eat a lot of fermented foods, i have had digestive ph issues that were in my lower gut. I had a lot of factors that coukd be it.

Well, no leafy greens or cabbage for a few days and the symptoms were 70% gone. Ibs and some high fiber foods like leafy grrens, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower , ect ofyen do not mix well. So that was what ckeared it up.

Thing is, i have a history of anemia. I live off foodstamps, im doing a higher amount of protien over fat. So i cant always afford red meat cuts in line with my needs. I dont like organ meats so use little if i use them. I like leafy greens. Amd they are a cheaper option, especially with me foraging amd growing some myself. They are less bioavailable, but are still really good. 

Well, i tried with komchi using my normal fermenting metjod. Did not work. i nixed for a while, but wad not happy. I like kimchi pver daurkraut. I like cabbage and leafy greens. So i looked up how fermentimg veg with whey might break down things more and gave making komcho with cauliflower, arugala, and chard a go. I used whey and more carrots and beets. Trued it yrsturday, no issue. I did a second meal with it today, and feel a bit bloated amd slightly gassy, but a bunch of canned mackeral amd pouch tuna likely is playing a part in that too. Its not bad or painful since i just ate. Not even uncomforyable, just feel really full With a slightly full tummy.

&lt;p&gt;I have hoshimotos. It caused a lot of issues including apparently digestive damage into my lower gi. Think really bad digestive ulcers causing shitting bright red blood for over a month coupled with severe stabbing stomach pain from evem drinking water .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was over 2 years and 5 months ago, over a year pre keto. Ive been baby stepping chamges for over 2 years with keto and if staring jan lasy year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as ive learned ive managed to find some food intolerances and catb intolerances. Ive found minor hiccups here and there and foubd solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In i think august or september last year, i really noticed a ongoing issue with stomach gurgling, bloating, gas, occadional pain, and spray paint poos. Amd i mean spray paint as in supet watery and very forceful evacuation of my colon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldnt figure out a cause. It wasnt too much magnesoum or too little calcium. It wasnt too much fermented food, it wasnt a electrolyte imbalance or too much or too little fiber, i thought. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing helped. Then, i ran out of all leafy greens and criciferous veg for a frw days. My dr had been suspecting ibs. But it wasnt the only likely cause. I have no gaulbladder, i eat a lot of fermented foods, i have had digestive ph issues that were in my lower gut. I had a lot of factors that coukd be it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, no leafy greens or cabbage for a few days and the symptoms were 70% gone. Ibs and some high fiber foods like leafy grrens, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower , ect ofyen do not mix well. So that was what ckeared it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thing is, i have a history of anemia. I live off foodstamps, im doing a higher amount of protien over fat. So i cant always afford red meat cuts in line with my needs. I dont like organ meats so use little if i use them. I like leafy greens. Amd they are a cheaper option, especially with me foraging amd growing some myself. They are less bioavailable, but are still really good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, i tried with komchi using my normal fermenting metjod. Did not work. i nixed for a while, but wad not happy. I like kimchi pver daurkraut. I like cabbage and leafy greens. So i looked up how fermentimg veg with whey might break down things more and gave making komcho with cauliflower, arugala, and chard a go. I used whey and more carrots and beets. Trued it yrsturday, no issue. I did a second meal with it today, and feel a bit bloated amd slightly gassy, but a bunch of canned mackeral amd pouch tuna likely is playing a part in that too. Its not bad or painful since i just ate. Not even uncomforyable, just feel really full With a slightly full tummy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, so far so good finding a work around. Definatly a non scale victory in my book so far. And it allows me tp balance conflicing health needs to find a midfle ground&lt;/p&gt;

Edit to Update: minor win tonight!

One of the big struggles I've had is when I have my kids. I'm divorced and have my kids every other week. So usually, I'll do well for a week while they are gone, then the moment they show up they open up that carb cupboard and ask for pizza for dinner and my willpower usually goes out the window and I eat a slice or 5 of pizza, eat all the Oreos, etc, and continue this way for the rest of the week.

But tonight, I stayed strong!! They wanted pizza and I ordered it for them and then I only ate the toppings! They had leftovers and I just put them away and didn't take even one bite!

&lt;p&gt;I fast for roughly 14 hours before my first cup of coffee with butter. I try to eat protein for breakfast (not hungry)- 2 eggs or a fathead bagel with cream cheese. I sometimes finish my protein shake or meat/cheese/salad for lunch, but usually only stomach half. I actually feel hungry before bedtime, which is when I eat something more substantial like steak and creamed spinach. &lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"I almost hate to share this, because they sometimes run out of some items. However, they may remove it altogether if not enough people use it. 

The salad bar in Amazon Fresh stores offer a number of very keto-friendly items at a very attractive price. Today, I had a bunch of buffalo chicken wings and at least half-a-pound of carnitas (think Mexican pulled pork without the sugar). You can also get grilled chicken, tuna fish and hard-boiled eggs, and of course different types of salad.

,keto,"So I’m just super confused because a few months ago my ac1 was down to 5.3! And I was so happy that I had reversed my prediabetes thinking for sure that was thanks to Keto! Also my cholesterol and blood pressure were all in range. 

But after insomnia and issues waking up at night with too much energy had bothered me for quite some time, I heard on this subreddit that keto is notorious for causing those sleep disturbances. Yet I wasn’t so sure that was the cause because I also have anxiety and adhd. 

But I also heard that waking up around 3am -6am is a blood sugar issue, so I decided to test to see if it was caused by the Dawn phenomenon and sure enough my blood sugar was at 6.3 at 4am!!!!!

So what has changed? Well a few things: 

1. I stopped taking Berberine in the last month or so. It’s commonly used for lowering blood sugar. So it’s upsetting to think my results were only from Berberine and had nothing to do with keto. Despite all the weight I’ve lost, you’d think my blood sugar wouldn’t be so high now. 

2. A few days ago I got fed up of insomnia and ate popcorn after not having grains for a long time. I also ate some storebought bread that was labeled as keto for two days, but I didn’t think it was low carb enough, i just wanted to test out if eating a bit more carbs would help me sleep better. And it actually did seem to improve my sleep a bit more! But I’ve been so afraid to add any grains back into my diet so I haven’t been doing that often. 

3. Usually I do intermittent fasting but yesterday I ate around 7pm which is later than usual.

4. I started on a medication called Lamogitrine 2 months ago. I’m worried it might also be raising my blood sugars. I saw some mention that it could cause low blood sugars. And it’s my understanding that being too low at night is what causes a blood sugar spike, causes an increase in cortisol and the liver dumps and wakes you up with energy. 

5. Also something I ate yesterday gave me terrible digestive issues even at night. I’m thinking it was likely the keto chocolates I ate because I never had those before. Maybe they even spiked my blood sugar during the day. 

So I’m not really sure how to narrow it down, I guess I’ll just have to monitor my blood sugar for awhile again and try to rule things out. 

But have any of you (those of you who had diabetes) experienced raised blood sugar with any of these things while on keto? 

I really hope my progress wasn’t just due to Berberine because i don’t want to be on medication for the rest of my life. There’s also contradicting studies about whether or not Berberine is safe. I guess I could go back on metformin especially since David Sinclair says it can help prolong life and prevent aging. But I’d rather not have to rely on meds.

&lt;p&gt;But I also heard that waking up around 3am -6am is a blood sugar issue, so I decided to test to see if it was caused by the Dawn phenomenon and sure enough my blood sugar was at 6.3 at 4am!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what has changed? Well a few things: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stopped taking Berberine in the last month or so. It’s commonly used for lowering blood sugar. So it’s upsetting to think my results were only from Berberine and had nothing to do with keto. Despite all the weight I’ve lost, you’d think my blood sugar wouldn’t be so high now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I got fed up of insomnia and ate popcorn after not having grains for a long time. I also ate some storebought bread that was labeled as keto for two days, but I didn’t think it was low carb enough, i just wanted to test out if eating a bit more carbs would help me sleep better. And it actually did seem to improve my sleep a bit more! But I’ve been so afraid to add any grains back into my diet so I haven’t been doing that often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually I do intermittent fasting but yesterday I ate around 7pm which is later than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started on a medication called Lamogitrine 2 months ago. I’m worried it might also be raising my blood sugars. I saw some mention that it could cause low blood sugars. And it’s my understanding that being too low at night is what causes a blood sugar spike, causes an increase in cortisol and the liver dumps and wakes you up with energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also something I ate yesterday gave me terrible digestive issues even at night. I’m thinking it was likely the keto chocolates I ate because I never had those before. Maybe they even spiked my blood sugar during the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m not really sure how to narrow it down, I guess I’ll just have to monitor my blood sugar for awhile again and try to rule things out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But have any of you (those of you who had diabetes) experienced raised blood sugar with any of these things while on keto? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope my progress wasn’t just due to Berberine because i don’t want to be on medication for the rest of my life. There’s also contradicting studies about whether or not Berberine is safe. I guess I could go back on metformin especially since David Sinclair says it can help prolong life and prevent aging. But I’d rather not have to rely on meds. 
I was really hoping keto would help me with that&lt;/p&gt;

So one month on keto (again 😅😬) my cravings hit their peak.  Wanted pizza, sweets, bread...  

So I went looking and found keto alternative recepies.  Fathead pizza anyone?  Low carb pizza sauce?  Buttered pecans?  Almond flour bread?  Yes, made them all, in one kitchen session! 😂 just had a fried egg on toast for the first time in ages and I've gotta say I'm over the moon with how everything has gone!

After the first month I went back to the gym, the first 2 weeks was just swimming starting gradually as I swim like someone drowning and then the latest 2 weeks I've thrown the gym in too before the swim and cut th swim by half.

Is this because if a lack of carbs? I have been leas active this past year than usual so that is almost certainly a contributing factor, but the 5.4 on the bleep felt like a marathon.

,keto,"4'10"" | 23 yo | SW: 200 lbs | CW: 164 | GW: TBD


Hi, folks! After 2 years of lurking and finally starting keto up again myself, I've run into a bit of a wall. I swapped from plain ADF after going from 200lbs to the low 170lbs.  I also got very sick during this stage and had to break my fasting schedule, so I decided to give keto a go. I'd officially broken through my P.I.S.S. stage of keto a few weeks ago and can't seem to make the scale budge. In fact, I feel like I'm bigger than I was before even at the same weight! My pants were loose and now they feel like they're getting back to fitting again. I've gone from a size 14 to size 10 skinny jean and I've lost about 10lbs if I don't include water weight but it all seems to be going in reverse over the past few weeks.

My food intake is very strict. I've cut out all added sugars and the only junk food I eat is a diet A&amp;W root beer. Sweetners don't seem to be the source of my ailments (luckily) but I'm looking for your opinions on the diet change I'm testing out this week. I typically eat at a 20:4 fasting window. For a snack, I usually have a single portion piece of cheese, some pepperoni, and some almonds. Admittedly, I could portion them better but I always make sure that I am well within my carb limit when I eat any types of nuts and snack cheese. For dinner, I eat a whole steak and when I'm extra hungry, I'll eat two fried eggs along with it. I've been doing this routine for just shy of two months, no cheat days at all!

For what I plan to do now to mix it up a little and get some new foods, I'll be following the same 20:4 schedule but instead have a few spoonfuls of protein yogurt and two or three strawberries for a snack. For dinner, I'll be swapping out full steaks for partial portions on salads and rotating it with chicken so I don't get sick of the routine. I don't eat much and if I have certain days where I get munchy I fully allow myself to eat a bit more. 

However,  I'm concerned that swapping out such a heavy, high protein diet for something lighter will throw off my weight loss as it automatically makes it so much lower in calories. Granted, I'm still a pretty fat woman for my frame and I have plenty of body fat to burn but I don't want to do anything unhealthy. So far, I'm full and satisfied on these new foods and I am keeping under 20 carbs. Adding in some fresh fruits makes it more sustainable for me but the calorie difference makes me sooo weary even though it's filling foods. Have any of you had success adding in salads and fruits to your keto diet or has it made it more difficult to get to your goals? I'll add my macros below, but it's so difficult to reach them when I'm not hungry enough to get them in.

&lt;p&gt;My food intake is very strict. I&amp;#39;ve cut out all added sugars and the only junk food I eat is a diet A&amp;amp;W root beer. Sweetners don&amp;#39;t seem to be the source of my ailments (luckily) but I&amp;#39;m looking for your opinions on the diet change I&amp;#39;m testing out this week. I typically eat at a 20:4 fasting window. For a snack, I usually have a single portion piece of cheese, some pepperoni, and some almonds. Admittedly, I could portion them better but I always make sure that I am well within my carb limit when I eat any types of nuts and snack cheese. For dinner, I eat a whole steak and when I&amp;#39;m extra hungry, I&amp;#39;ll eat two fried eggs along with it. I&amp;#39;ve been doing this routine for just shy of two months, no cheat days at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For what I plan to do now to mix it up a little and get some new foods, I&amp;#39;ll be following the same 20:4 schedule but instead have a few spoonfuls of protein yogurt and two or three strawberries for a snack. For dinner, I&amp;#39;ll be swapping out full steaks for partial portions on salads and rotating it with chicken so I don&amp;#39;t get sick of the routine. I don&amp;#39;t eat much and if I have certain days where I get munchy I fully allow myself to eat a bit more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,  I&amp;#39;m concerned that swapping out such a heavy, high protein diet for something lighter will throw off my weight loss as it automatically makes it so much lower in calories. Granted, I&amp;#39;m still a pretty fat woman for my frame and I have plenty of body fat to burn but I don&amp;#39;t want to do anything unhealthy. So far, I&amp;#39;m full and satisfied on these new foods and I am keeping under 20 carbs. Adding in some fresh fruits makes it more sustainable for me but the calorie difference makes me sooo weary even though it&amp;#39;s filling foods. Have any of you had success adding in salads and fruits to your keto diet or has it made it more difficult to get to your goals? I&amp;#39;ll add my macros below, but it&amp;#39;s so difficult to reach them when I&amp;#39;m not hungry enough to get them in.&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"In the middle of my journey, just posting a few things that may be of use for others. I've done keto with some success in the past, but have generally had significant brain fog (with weight loss) or more recently lack of weight loss. I've made two changes this time that seem to help. I'm tall, cw 245, gw 220. I'm down from 285 a couple of years ago (lifestyle changes, not keto, but plateau for the last year or so around 240/250)

1. electrolyte supplementation - I work out and sweat 3-4 times a week, and for whatever reason internalized the 'sodium is bad' health messaging. With this go at keto, I'm supplementing with reasonable amounts of salt, potassium(losalt), and magnesium(calm), and in general not restricting salt particularly when I crave it. It seems to have helped with the brain fog, which so far doesn't seem to be an issue. (the faq and this channel have been very helpful on that topic)
2. 'low' fat. Past few attempts at keto I've eaten a lot of nuts and cheese and in general had the idea that 'fat is good/healthy'. This time around I'm skipping that and just going with protein (meat/fish), greens, and non-starchy vegetables, with enough fat for flavor. I still have a few nuts and a little cheese here and there, but very little. Just a mindset shift that is useful. The keto macro calculator recommended significantly more grams of protein than fat, so I'm really on a high protein protocol... (ran across some vides by dr eric westman (sp.?) that have provided some practical insights on these topics)
3. Improved some eating behaviors before starting this round of keto - specifically late night eating, stress eating. Mostly through breath work and a few approaches to meditation. Happy to share more details if anyone is interested.

So! So far this has been  pretty easy and enjoyable, and weight loss is occurring as expected and without a lot of stress. Workouts are not as high energy without carbs, but I'm ok with that while I'm in this part of the process.

It's my understanding that the purpose of keto is partly to keep your blood sugar from spiking. I read that maltodextrin acts just like sugar in your body, and the stevia I buy is mixed with ""Dextrose with Maltodextrin"". Is this something significant enough to worry about?

I considered Splenda as an alternative because stevia is bitter anyway. Is it true that sucralose sweeteners are only ketogenic if you don't cook them?

I read these articles but I still need would like opinions from people who have done more reliable research than I have. For context, my main reason for following this diet is for weight loss and lymphedema. I am also on a very tight budget and have to do this in the most affordable way possible.

Guys, I feel like I'm finally getting my stride with this keto/fitness thing. I've been keto (off and on) for over a year, but have struggled with the fitness aspect of it. I've been following keto strictly again for a couple of months, and I finished week two of my new program this morning. I noticed that my inner left elbow tendon is sore. Because of this, I wore a brace this morning when I did my PULL sesh (I just got over an overuse injury in the other elbow from shoveling snow last winter, so I already had a brace).  
  
  
  
I want to act like it isn't that sore, but unfortunately it is. Thing is, I can't stop. It takes me so f\*\*king long to get my stride with some things, and I'm so afraid if I stop it'll take another year to get back on track. I know that probably sounds dumb, but that's where I'm at.  
  
My current schedule looks like this:  
  
Monday: Legs/cardio  
  
Tuesday: PUSH/cardio  
  
Wednesday: LISS  
  
Thursday: Legs/cardio  
  
Friday: PULL/cardio  
  
PUSH is mostly dumbbell exercises, and PULL is mostly cable/machines. I do 20-30 mins of cardio after every workout for cardiovascular health, not for calorie burning.

I added back a modest amount of berries and nuts.  That's about it.

I still avoid all carbs possible.  I figure enough sneak in on the good food anyway.

Still no bread, pastry, fruit juice, wine, beer, rice, potatoes, desserts, candy, bagels, etc.

Here are the details of the journey:  About 3 years ago I weighed just under 240 lbs.  I began by reducing carbs and eliminating seed oils and pork (high omega6).  I began eating lots of beef, more fish, cheese, whipped cream (high 40% butterfat).   Lots of the right veg also.

The big hurtle was mentally getting over the old time ""Fat makes you fat"" mantra of misguided food advice.  Truth is that good fat is very nutritious and provides a high level of satiety so there is no hunger to combat.

Then I went to a modified 2 MAD eating plan.  I eat late morning and early evening.  And have a early morning ""Massai Milkshake"".  That is 50 grams of whole milk organic kefer and 20 grams of high butterfat whip cream, with a dash of cinnamon.  A very modest serving of really good stuff.  No hunger after that for sure.

Height is 6 feet.  Waist is 35.5 inches. Weight is 195.  Age 69.  BP is 109/73.  Blood sugar is 80 to 90.  No meds.

,keto,"Hello everybody, 

Today I am finishing week 5 of keto and I can say I feel pretty good about my results. 
One big thing on this sub is I couldn’t find anyone with my build doing keto and showing their results so I didn’t really know what to expect.  I’ll admit my weight didn’t do much after the first week. I dropped 5lbs almost immediately which I’m sure was water. Then I fluctuated between 188-185 for the next several weeks. Finally broke plateau this last week and got down to 182lbs.  I am definitely one of those people who would stand on the scale every morning and be discouraged and at first I didn’t want to take progress pictures but I did and I’m glad I did.  With a muscle building workout program I was burning fat and building muscle so that scale wasn’t moving but my photos show results undoubtably.  
Keto isn’t some miracle solution.  It’s probably one of the more challenging things I have stuck to. With all the tracking of macros and having will power to cook every day and NOT just get a dirty keto cheat meal at McDonald’s. 

I am 5’8” - 30y/o - 
SW: 194lbs 
CW: 182lbs 
GW: 160lbs 

I also want to mention I dropped all vaping and drinking alcohol. No weekend warrior stuff or anything. I have tried keto in the past and without a doubt I would fail when I woke up with a hang over. Do yourself a favor and quit now otherwise what’s the point of all the hard work? 

I have been working out 4-5x weekly doing LIIFT4 on the beach body app and cycling 10-15miles  1-2x weekly.
I have always been one to not want to track macros as I just didn’t understand what the hell I was doing.  It was a simple google search away and just time of trail and error. 
I started with 30grams of net carbs daily and 50grams of total carbs. 
Eventually I figured I need to step up my game and go down to 30 grams of total carbs and 20 net carbs. 
I have also been intaking 1500 calories for the day and haven’t felt any fatigue or exhaustion from this. 
This amount works for me and would recommend listening to your body (with some control).  
Another thing I always see on here is people worried about electrolytes/salts/etc. This is something I don’t look into all that much as I don’t feel any of the symptoms some people explain while on keto.

,keto,"Due to the most recent posts regarding artificial sweeteners, I thought it would be more prudent to post some links about the benefits of the Amino Acid Glycine instead of just commenting ""glycine"" on every post. 

Glycine is one of the most critical amino acids in the human body. It is critical to numerous cellular repair mechanisms, neurological processes, and plays an extremely important part in metabolic health, among other functions that are too numerous for me to list. It is also the major component of Glutathione production, which is the most important antioxidant manufactured inside of our bodies. 

I am the biggest fan of Glycine for several reasons, but the main ones are:

1. It tastes, looks, and feels like real sugar. It is a perfect substitute for baking, caramelizing, coffee, and iced tea, among other things. 

2. It helped me to get rid of alcoholic fatty liver disease induced by 25 years of everyday drinking, and all the joint pain and damage from 20 years of hard labor doing construction are gone. Keto helped this tremendously on its own, but the addition of Glycine was the thing that really got me to where I am now. 

3. I was a heavy smoker for 25 years starting at 14 years old. The smoking, drinking 100 plus beers a week, and working outside in the sun all day did a serious number on my face. My Irish baby face turned into a wrinkled, grizzled mess by 37 years old. 

I started Keto at this time, quit smoking, and reduced my drinking to once or twice a month. Keto and these actions helped tremendously to repair a lot of this damage, but It was the addition of daily Glycine supplementation that really supercharged the rejuvenation of my face. My winkles are gone, and my skin has regained it's appropriate elasticity and suppleness. I just turned 40, and for all the damage I did to myself, I am constantly misconstrued  as being in my late 20's/early 30's. 

4. Unless you are consuming 2+ pounds of meat and all the gristle and connective tissue that comes with it, it is very likely there is a deficiency. The human body can only synthesize 2g a day, when it really requires minimum 10g for optimal function. Our ancestors had no problem eating this much when they were hunter gatherers because they ate everything, the tendons, skin, connective tissue and gristle. This dietary intake does not happen anymore, and the amount we produce ourselves is just not sufficient, especially as we get older.

5. My mother suffers from osteoporosis and severe rheumatoid arthritis. I moved her in with me when she fell and broke her ribs twice in 6 months. She was a nurse for 20 years, so of course she was a difficult patient. She did not want medication for her conditions despite being basically crippled and unable to do basic tasks at the age of 71. I started giving her bone broth everyday, and got rid of all her artificial sweeteners  and replaced them with Glycine. I give her 5g of glycine per day, plus whatever she gets from the bone broth and 1 pound of meat I feed her daily. In less than 2 years, she has regained 75% of her function, movement and flexibility despite not being on any medications or pain management. All of her gut issues went away as well, which I'm convinced were cause by the Sweeteners she was using. She also regained a more youthful appearance, and now looks to be in her early 60's. This all is from Glycine alone. 

The point of all of this is, Glycine is an amazing supplement and sweetener alternative, and I hope you folks look into it. I am linking a couple of resources for anyone that is interested. The typical supplementing dose is 2-5 grams per day. As always, check with your doc and medication interactions before using.  I buy mine from bulk supplements on amazon, but there are other sources as well. 

This is my testimony for my situation alone. At the very least, here is a sweetener option that tastes good for those looking for an alternative.

,keto,"Hi,
I (30f) started keto May 1st, almost a month now and I only lose 1kg so far. Waist size is down around 3cm. 
SW: 70kg CW: 69 GW: 53

Anyone ever experience slow weight loss on keto let's say two to three months into it? And what was your experience? I read somewhere that some people do start to lose after months. In need of tips and maybe similar experience to keep me motivated.

Typical daily meal:
No breakfast.
Lunch: (2 big/3small) Boiled eggs / scrambled egg with salt.
Dinner: Sauteed beef belly with lettuce/ grilled salmon/chicken thigh (around 150gr of beef and chicken, 200gr-250gr for salmon depending on the cut). 

I use mostly olive oil whenever I need or butter but no vegetable oil.

Have a slice of keto cake / cookie that I baked myself in between meal (almond flour,erythritol/stevia, eggs, baking powder, butter)

Currently I am comfortable with this setting. Lunch, snack, and dinner. I start eating at 12 for lunch and end my meal at 6 latest for dinner. I don't eat anything else after dinner. 

Exercise 3 times a week doing cardio for maybe 30 minutes to 1 hour each.

,keto,"I went (back to) keto diet around February this year, around 158lbs.
I started keto for weigh loss for my sport (climbing-bouldering) but also for improved mental clarity, stable energy level, improved immunity system.

Until beginning of May I didn't really enjoyed keto as much as I thought, I had the benefits, but also some inconvenience, like nausea during the day, diziness when training, waking up wide awake between 4h30 to 6AM in the morning sleeping generally less than 6hours per night. I tried modifying my electrolytes and salts intakes in different way but nothing was doing it.

What changed everything is eating enough protein. Didn't really realized protein where a target to reach so I guess my body was having a hard time feeding my muscle.
But even then I struggled losing the weight I wanted off, plateauing at 155 lbs so I started intermittent fasting 2 weeks ago, eating around 1600kcal per day, 30g of net carbs or less and reaching my protein goal.

I'm now at 150lbs and no more nausea since the day i eat enough protein, I also feel even better than before, particularly when training (and fasted), I feel like Gravity apply way less force over me, thats and amazing feeling. 
The sleep is still not how I would like it too, I usually sleep around 6hours per night, sometimes 7h30 (pre-keto 7h30 was my minimum) but even with 6hours I feel great, not tired and ready to tackle the day ahead, so I guess I'll see it more as a positive things in the near future as I get used to it.

To conclude, I still have some fats pads to loose to be lighters on the climbing walls, I believe 142lbs would be ideal for me according to my muscle mass (I'm 5'10), but I'll probably gain a bit of muscle here and there so I'm won't really have a goal anymore and juste keep doing what I do as long as I still feel amazing doing it.",t2_6hwhi4dq,False,,0,False,Finaly reached 150lbs after bumpy ride,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Success Story'}]",r/keto,False,6,success,0,,,False,t3_13schwq,False,dark,0.93,,public,71,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Success Story,False,71,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1685105733.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.keto,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went (back to) keto diet around February this year, around 158lbs.

,keto,"I don’t think I ever really had stevia before. Maybe very small amounts. I never really enjoyed sweets that much. At the start of this week, a friend asked me if I wanted a case of stevia ginger ale he didn’t like. I said ok, as i heard it’s a natural sweetener that doesn’t cause intentional distress like sugar alcohols.

Had one with dinner and thought it was pretty good so I had another while watching tv before bed. While laying in bed my stomach felt strange, not super painful or anything but weird. There are NO sugar alcohols in this brand of ginger ale, it’s exclusively sweetened with stevia.

I had issues falling asleep but didn’t think much of it. I woke up after 4 hours wide awake and felt like garbage for the rest of the day.

The next day I didn’t drink any ginger ale, went to bed early, slept like a baby for 10 hours - even slept through my alarm. I guess I needed to catch up on sleep.

Now yesterday throughout the day, I kind of got a bit gluttonous and had 3 cans of ginger ale. I just really liked it, wasn’t overtly sweet and I’m a huge fan of ginger and carbonated/fizzy beverages. Once again my stomach started to feel kind of strange, but not super bad or anything. This is when I started to realize that the stevia is doing something to my stomach.

Then last night I laid in bed for 6 or 7 hours completely unable to sleep. I ended up calling into work because there was no way I was working on 2 hours of sleep. Eventually I got out of bed and did some light cleaning for 3 hours, finally was able to fall asleep maybe 10 hours after I last consumed stevia, and slept ok.

I am almost 100% positive that stevia has a strange psychological effect on me. I am unsure if it is acting as a stimulant or what. But I NEVER have issues sleeping. I forgot how horrible it feels to be low on sleep because I’ve probably gotten 8 hours every single night for &gt;5 years straight. It really seems like the stevia is causing this, as it’s essentially the only thing in my diet/life that has changed.

Upon googling “stevia sleep disruptions”, I can’t find anything online. I do however see posts from random people on various websites saying they’ve also experienced this, but everyone in the comments denies it happening to them.

,keto,"Been on keto for almost two months (steadily losing about 1 pound a week), so I decided to write short list of things I don't read about that often but definitely jump out to me. *(Pure personal experience, I'm not an expert, all of that. Also, first post!)*

1. People WILL notice that you lost weight, even one pound. *I used to really dislike the idea of losing weight myself because I considered it too much work, and that it would take months for me or anyone to notice a change, but I was wrong. It's so motivating to hear ""you look great, you lost weight, didn't you?"" so often.*
2. Delicious doesn't mean it will make you fat, despite what I thought all my life. *The few times I was in a diet before, I remember thinking things like ""Mhh, this salad isn't good, but this ranch dressing is great, so I must use it with precaution."" or ""Oof, I really overdid it with the butter on this omelet, should I skip lunch?"" It's so ridiculous.*
3. How easy it is to consume less calories when you take away the carbs. *Even the days when I overate like crazy, after registering my macros it turned out I only went a bit over my weight-losing goal.  On a particular cheat day, I was already over 1500 cals BEFORE LUNCH. It's crazy.*
4. There are much better ways to obtain enough fiber than my former breakfast cereal. *At least for me, since I love cauliflower and artichokes, a lot.*
5. None, absolutely none, of the fast-food places in my area have keto options. *Seriously, I checked. I thought I hit jackpot when I found a small salads-to-go kinda thing, but they bread pretty much every protein, and all of their salads have croutons and some fruit like strawberries or raisins, oh and they only sell combos with a beverage, which is either soda or fruit juice. Also McDonald's Caesar salad is not keto for some ungodly reason.*
6. How many prepacked products are sweetened. *And how sometimes they sell the unsweetened version for an extra. Really? I specially noticed it with Greek yogurt, but it happens on all food sections.*
7. Breakfast isn't the most important meal of the day. *Don't get me wrong, I know getting the right nutrients for your day is important, but now I skip breakfast often and I'm personally doing great, and I feel my mornings go by slower, in a good way. Anyone else?*
8. How good does it feel. *Well, people definitely talk about this one. But it's true. I'm rarely hungry now, but having a good meal is always still as pleasant. I have an adequate amount of energy, I sleep well, I drink lots of water without forcing myself to (I luckily didn't get a keto fever besides being very thirsty). It feels good, simple as that.*",t2_9ngrzwxd,False,,0,False,Things I didn't expect when started.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Success Story'}]",r/keto,False,6,success,0,,,False,t3_13r1taa,False,dark,0.96,#edeff1,public,20,1,{},,bf715102-aa2c-11e9-835a-0e92680f1d3e,False,[],,False,False,,{},Success Story,False,20,,False,False,self,False,black,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'M, 179cm 101kg, sedentary, 4kg lost so far'}]",{},,True,,1684971828.0,richtext,6,,,richtext,self.keto,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Been on keto for almost two months (steadily losing about 1 pound a week), so I decided to write short list of things I don&amp;#39;t read about that often but definitely jump out to me. &lt;em&gt;(Pure personal experience, I&amp;#39;m not an expert, all of that.

Third try on keto after trying it successfully once, and failed twice... with a long failure.

But I was at my all time high.  I went onto keto around the beginning of March again.  And since then I'm already down 30 lbs. Which in 2 months is great.  But i Have skipped my normal birthday stuff.  Sit around people eating at gatherings while eating nothing.  And worst of all, I want it.  I want all of that food.

The problem is i have 3 taste aversions that make me violently repulsed.  Eggs, mushrooms, seafood.

Everyone says oh just stick with it.  You'll lose cravings, you'll lose your appetite.  But I don't. Even after 6 months on it.  I never did.  Today I noticed I had to go down two notches on my belt.   And it felt great. 

But I just want to have a nice slice of cake, some mac and cheese, a pizza, some fries.  

I've tried keto alternatives and they always just leave me wanting the real thing.  So I've been even stricter this time and haven't had the keto cheesecake.  Or keto biscuits etc.   Because they aren't as good.

&lt;p&gt;The problem is i have 3 taste aversions that make me violently repulsed.  Eggs, mushrooms, seafood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone says oh just stick with it.  You&amp;#39;ll lose cravings, you&amp;#39;ll lose your appetite.  But I don&amp;#39;t. Even after 6 months on it.  I never did.  Today I noticed I had to go down two notches on my belt.   And it felt great. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I just want to have a nice slice of cake, some mac and cheese, a pizza, some fries.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried keto alternatives and they always just leave me wanting the real thing.  So I&amp;#39;ve been even stricter this time and haven&amp;#39;t had the keto cheesecake.  Or keto biscuits etc.   Because they aren&amp;#39;t as good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;m bad at lying to myself.  Or maybe I enjoyed food more then most prior to going on keto.  But I&amp;#39;m really struggling to not just go to Costco, get a cake, get some Mac n cheese and bbq pork and go home and have a dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been wanting to restart keto for awhile and just have not been able to get myself into it. I've been really into eating farm fresh &amp; kinda fancy. So I thought making this menu might help trick me into realizing I can eat low carb and this ""way"". 

Let me know what you guys think. Oh, and I'd love to hear your restaurant quality ideas. : )

I want to mention, I've done keto before and none of the fake flours or sweeteners have ever worked or tasted great for me, which is why I chose to do natural foods + cheese only. Also, looking it over again, I feel like I'm gonna get hate for the peach salad but I only am planning on eating ~ 1/2 (~ 7 carbs).

(P.S. Thought y'all would love the sausages portion, lol. Also I am two months sober before anyone wants to suggest some alcohol!)

,keto,"Background: Young woman in her 20s, being treated for a hypothyroidism with 60mg Armour Thyroid. Also taking Zyrtec and Hyrdoxine *(alternating)* for allergies. 

So I went on vacation, and after it was over I never got fully into Keto again. I was doing intermittent fasting as well. It’s been a few months and I’m trying to ease into it again.

I was weary of posting because I’ve never known exactly what I was doing. I had a personal trainer/nutritionist at the time, and he encouraged me to start it *(he’s been doing Keto for the last 13 years and he’s in amazing shape at 50yrs old)*. I don’t truly understand macros. I just followed his directions. I downloaded Cronometer and tracked everything.

After awhile, I stopped tracking because I knew generally what I needed and it was working. I was cooking Keto Green Chef meals, but I no longer have them. Other than those, I was mostly consuming fish, chicken, dairy and milk or whey protein shakes with oils. I was also taking supplements *(L-Tyrosine, L-Theanine, D3 10,000iu, Iron as needed, Zinc procilionate, Women’s multi, magnesium, and collagen powder)*. I stopped because it is currently unaffordable for me. Magnesium also upset my stomach so I quit that one for good.

My problem is I have a lot of food intolerances, and this was always a problem when I started Keto. I felt great on the diet! My mood improved, I maintained a healthy weight, I had lots of energy, but my bowel movements suffered. Here is what I’m working with:

1. I’m lactose intolerant. I had to stop drinking muscle milks and eating cheese. I also adore cheese so this is just sad. 
2. I discovered eating avocado makes my stomach horribly upset. Worse than dairy. I can’t tolerate it at all for some reason. Can’t get fats in this way.
3. Coconut upsets my stomach. I was using 1-2tbsp of coconut oil in my shakes, but that gave me awful stomach pain and diarrhea. MCT oil produces the same result. 
4. Along the lines of dairy again, I enjoy having a plain black milk tea in the morning. At the time, I used heavy creme instead of milk. This combined with other dairy really upsets the stomach. Caffine I heard can also make you need the restroom. Had to stop drinking this.
5. Not essential to a Keto diet, but I learned that ginger upsets my stomach too. This detail could help you understand my sensitivities perhaps?
6. Not intolerant, but please do not suggest tuna because I’ve tried (over and over again) and it truly just makes me want to vomit because I find it disgusting. 
7. I have problems with my jaw. I’m trying to get treatment, but it’s going to take a long time. I can’t yet. So chewing steak is super hard for me and I generally avoid it. It is possible, but it cannot be daily. I also have a weird aversion to fatty/slimy feeling foods. I always get lean meat because fat makes me want to vomit otherwise. I really do try, but I couldn’t get over it.

How do I get back into Keto, but this time being conscious of any intolerances or food aversions? It seems I can’t have any of the foods I enjoy even though they are perfect for Keto.

I am obsessive and something that is regimented works very well for me. I can eat the same thing daily and it doesn't really bug me. I usually just change up dinner.

I also do IF 16/8 between 11am and 7 pm.
Fasted cardio and weights 3 to 5 days a week depending on what's going on for that week.
I also average between 10k and 20k on any given day with or without working out.

,keto,"Hi.

I started keto in 2018 when I was 28 at 168 pounds and did it religiously. I lost 15 pounds the first month and 40 pounds in a year. Once I reached my goal weight I stuck to IF and a relatively low carb diet and kept the weight off for a while. Then I got covid twice and went through some personal tragedies and put on 50 pounds in a year.

I restarted keto 10 days ago at 175 pounds, recalculated my macros which were pretty much the same and have been very good at following it. But for some reason this time, the scale is stuck. I've only lost 2 pounds in ten days and I'm worried because I'm doing everything right.

OMAD is ok to have a collagen or protein shake if you are doing lots of weights and want to build muscle?

## Other Info

I've been eating keto for about 10 years.

I am 36m and my weight has been stable since after the first year on keto when I lost about 35 lbs. 

I was fasted for ~14 hours before the blood draw.

## Next Steps

Some of the numbers are a bit concerning (high LDL-C and LDL-P), but some others seem pretty good like my LDL size.

My new PCP immediately recommended statins, but I am scheduled with a cardiologist soon and will see what they have to say and try to get all the scans to check for any build-up so far.

My arm-chair research makes me think I may be a borderline ""lean mass hyper responder"". I'm not opposed to re-adding some amount of carbs to my diet for the sake of lowering my LDL, but I do enjoy the benefits of eating very low carb. I think I would choose a diet change over statins though.

Sadly, I don't have any pre-keto tests to show what my numbers were in the past, so we will just have to see how things go from here.

Take care, friends!

Anyway-&gt;

I am 39 male, 6'0, 170lbs. Most people would say I am in good shape, some would say I am in excellent shape. Either way my abs show and I have muscles. I can post a picture if it's helpful.

I've started keto and intermittent fasting (eating between 12pm and 8pm). Doing electrolites, etc. I row to 250 cal a day and then lift like... 75-90 mins (I am doing a lot, I know). This is 5-6 days a week. 

Right now I have my daily macros at 

2000 cal, 20g carbs, 124g fat, 187g protein.

I set my calorie count first to account for calorie deficit (I am open to increasing the amount of calories I eat). Then I accounted for 20g carbs and (my weight in kg x 1.1g) for protein.

,keto,"Last week, I (25F, 26 next week) had a colonoscopy on 5/16 due to various chronic congenital colon issues. I’ve been keto since Oct 2021 for neurological health.

Because of these GI issues, I had to do a specific diet prep and a specific bowel prep for the best results.

These issues include dysmotility in the small and large intestines, rectal outlet dysfunction, and a potential congenital colon disease (Hirschsprung) that will require a surgical biopsy in order to determine the diagnosis. However, I did test negative for Crohn’s disease and colitis, so that’s good.

The week before my scope, from 5/8-5/11, I removed all fiber and vegetables for four days and essentially did a modified carnivore diet.

On 5/12-5/13, I ate soft solid foods (no chewing allowed) and then I did a 48-hour bowel prep (4L solution) with clear liquids from 5/14-5/15.

I was allowed to resume my normal diet after a few days, and boy was I glad! 

I restarted full keto on 5/20, and my carb-induced acne and sweating/body odor is already improving, along with shedding water retention. I’m feeling so much better than I did before!

I’ve been keto since Oct 2021 for neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of these GI issues, I had to do a specific diet prep and a specific bowel prep for the best results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues include dysmotility in the small and large intestines, rectal outlet dysfunction, and a potential congenital colon disease (Hirschsprung) that will require a surgical biopsy in order to determine the diagnosis. However, I did test negative for Crohn’s disease and colitis, so that’s good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week before my scope, from 5/8-5/11, I removed all fiber and vegetables for four days and essentially did a modified carnivore diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 5/12-5/13, I ate soft solid foods (no chewing allowed) and then I did a 48-hour bowel prep (4L solution) with clear liquids from 5/14-5/15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was allowed to resume my normal diet after a few days, and boy was I glad! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I restarted full keto on 5/20, and my carb-induced acne and sweating/body odor is already improving, along with shedding water retention. I’m feeling so much better than I did before!&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"Hello all! I recently started Keto again after successfully losing over 40 pounds the last time I did it (about 5 years ago). I'm a 5.9 male at 220 pounds trying to get down to 165 depending on muscle. Mainly I want to fit back into my size 32 pants. I was drinking heavily prior to keto, buy now am sober for nearly a month. With all of that in mind, I'm trying to do keto again but a healthier version. Last time I did it, all I ate was horrible things like hot dogs, sausage, bacon, eggs, you name it. This time around I'm trying to make a mediterranean inspired version of keto. 

My question is, are these macros that I'm hitting going to be a problem. My main goal is to do Keto  until I reach my target pant size and then switch over to a mediterranean carb conscious diet. I haven't decided what that looks like yet but maybe something under 100 - 150 in carbs? My problem is when I get off Keto I eat poorly so I'm trying to keep the foods the same as if I was off Keto with just less restriction. Here is what my current day looks like.

My typical day I consume:
1384 calories
104g protein 
91g fat
15 net carbs

My foods consist of:

Breakfast:
Black coffee and fast until 12pm and then at 12 one large avocado net carb 3.1 ish

Lunch
Keto culture baking bread 4 oz of shredded chicken sandwich with primal kitchen buffalo sauce net carbs 4.1

Dinner
Salad with 85g baby spinach, 28g heavenly tomatos, 56g sliced baby bella mushrooms, 30g Ken's Caesar dressing with 6 oz of tuna net carb 4.7

Afterwork and still hungry
Sometimes I'm still hungry after working on the ambulance, so I'll eat 3 zero net carb mini tortillas with 4oz of chicken, 1 slice cheese cheddar split into 3, and some spinach and buffalo sauce. Net carbs 2.9

My snacks include
1 Baybel semi soft cheese, 28g cheese whisps, 14g macadamia, 14g pecan, 1 archer grass-fed beef stick.

I don't eat these snacks everyday because I'm trying to stay under 1500 calories, but they are available if I'm jonesing for food.

I have elevated cholesterol and I am trying to do this safely by avoiding too much high cholesterol foods in hope that keto will actually lower my cholesterol instead of raising it. What do you guys think? Suggestions or changes? I'd my protein fat ratio going to be a problem? Am I receiving enough nutrition from food alone or should I be supplementing? Suggestions on converting from keto to non ketp diet after reaching pant size? Any info would really help because I'm trying to do this right this time.

,keto,"I'm glad that things like cauliflower mashed potatoes, keto ice cream, and fathead pizza exist. But I find it way too easy to overeat on these foods.

My wife is a huge fan of cauliflower mashed potatoes. Every once in a while I make them, and I end up thinking these are SO GOOD and pound down way more than I should. Then I do that math afterwards and realize I've consumed way too many carbs. In my pre-keto world, I would eat mashed potatoes all the time, since I am not a fan of pasta, and I REALLY don't like rice. So, for a while there I was eating huge heaps of cauliflower mashes potatoes daily.

Same problem with any keto pizza. Instead of 2 slices, I have 4 slices.

Keto ice cream, I am eating the whole pint. I can't stop myself. 

If I limit myself to meats and a low carb vegetable, then I'm usually fine.

It's one of the reasons I have not tried any of the keto french toast recipes. I'm afraid I'm going ot go overboard.

None of these foods will ever get me to pre-keto carb levels. But they can get me to 50g of carbs and knock my blood sugar up a good 20-30 points.

So, now I really limit myself with any substitution food that's too close to the real thing. Instead of cauliflower mashed potatoes, I'll make loaded broccoli. Instead of keto pizza, I make pizza quiche. Keto ice cream, I have maybe once a month or once every 2 months.

What's interesting about Keto ice cream is availability. My local grocery store carries a keto ice cream, whose name escapes me (Rebel brand, I believe).

I started keto and 16/8 IF (8-12pm) on the 5th of March 2023. I fairly strictly constrain my calorie intake to 1,500 kcal / day and my net carb intake to &lt; 20g / day. I take potassium and magnesium supplements every day before my first meal. I try to drink a lot of water.

I try to focus on simple meals using non-processed food: cheese omelettes, steaks, spinach salads, salmon with asparagus, etc. I track everything using:

* a blood monitor (12pm; before my first meal)
* digital scale (6.30am; after getting out of bed)
* Apple Watch (energy, workouts)
* Cronometer (food)

I have been fairly strict with only one cheat meal (side of french fries). Between April 7th and April 20th I kind of lost discipline and stopped tracking macros and calories. In early May I didn't eat enough fat, had increased hunger and thus increased (non-carb) snacking.

One thing I haven't curbed yet are diet sodas, of which I consume a lot (\~1L/day).

I have been very happy with my progress so far and intend to continue on this track until I reach a weight of 100 kg. At that point I am thinking of some sort of maintenance mode with some way of enjoying a pizza/burger every now and then.

One open question I have is why my fasting blood sugar is so high. The only thing I consume before testing around 12pm is 2-3 cups of black coffee.

,keto,"Sorry this is a vague question, I'm trying to explain it as simply as I can. 

Basically my stomach for the last few days has had this ""excited"" feeling, which I can't explain. It's basically anxiety and it travels up in to my throat sometimes causing it to tense. 

Clearly it's some form of anxiety at a muscular level which is fine. Since it is associated with the tightness in my throat. 

After posting here before I've learned to keep my electrolytes on point. I'm taking 2 teaspoons of potassium, 500mg of magnesium mix (unfortunately not the best but it's what I can afford) and generous amounts of sea salt throughout the day. 

I'm considering that the anxiety feeling is just muscular manifestations of emotional thing since I have been emotional at points the last 20 days. Also I am wondering if it's something that could possibly be to do with bacteria die off or something? 

I don't have cravings for carbs persay but my brain is trying to trick me in to believing carbs would remedy my anxiety feeling. I suppose that is what a craving is more or less though isn't it. 

Could this be bacteria die off at the 20 day mark?

&lt;p&gt;Basically my stomach for the last few days has had this &amp;quot;excited&amp;quot; feeling, which I can&amp;#39;t explain. It&amp;#39;s basically anxiety and it travels up in to my throat sometimes causing it to tense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly it&amp;#39;s some form of anxiety at a muscular level which is fine. Since it is associated with the tightness in my throat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After posting here before I&amp;#39;ve learned to keep my electrolytes on point. I&amp;#39;m taking 2 teaspoons of potassium, 500mg of magnesium mix (unfortunately not the best but it&amp;#39;s what I can afford) and generous amounts of sea salt throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m considering that the anxiety feeling is just muscular manifestations of emotional thing since I have been emotional at points the last 20 days. Also I am wondering if it&amp;#39;s something that could possibly be to do with bacteria die off or something? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have cravings for carbs persay but my brain is trying to trick me in to believing carbs would remedy my anxiety feeling. I suppose that is what a craving is more or less though isn&amp;#39;t it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could this be bacteria die off at the 20 day mark? &lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"Long time lurker, first time poster. 

When I found out I (29M) was going to be a dad in the summer of 2020 I was filled with absolute joy and also immense fear that I wasn’t healthy enough to be the kind of dad I wanted to be. I was depressed, unhealthy, obese and unhappy with who I was and what I looked like. My joints hurt, I had no energy, no self confidence. I tipped the scales at 280 lbs and told myself I could absolutely not let myself hit 300. I NEEDED to be happy in order to raise a happy kid. 

So I started Keto. Cold turkey. I seem to thrive on structure and keto seemed to be perfect for that. I knew what I had to do. 

So I kept the net carbs under 20. I started running everyday. The weight started falling off! Just a few months later my clothes were too big. I was getting compliments at work. My director who I saw infrequently at the time didn’t even recognize me! So I kept going… kept pushing myself. I was starting to be happy! I was happy to be in pictures with my son. I had energy to play with him. My body didn’t hurt anymore. 

While this all sounds so great and like the perfect ending to my weight-loss story, it came with a cost. My wife began to resent me for losing the weight and for prioritizing my health. I dealt with a constant attack of negative comments, of her jealousy and fear and her own insecurities that I was succeeding and she wasn’t. She couldn’t seem to be happy for me. While our relationship was not perfect in a lot of ways, this was the final straw in what I was willing to put up with.

I slipped back into depression during this time. Somehow I still kept going strong on Keto. We ended up separating after 6 months of marriage counseling in which we spent two whole sessions talking about my weight loss and how it was unhealthy and making her feel undesirable. How it was making her feel like I didn’t love her and how it was all about me and wanting to look better for other people. 

“Loving someone long term is attending 1,000 funerals of the person they used to be.” The fat me died and she was nowhere to be seen. So we divorced. 

AND….

I JUST hit 100lbs lost! 178.2 lbs said the scale this morning! To be honest, it feels like so much more weight has been lifted from my shoulders and I am happier than I can ever remember being. I’m not done yet! I still have some more fat to lose. I started working out at a gym to put on some muscle! My mom is now 6 weeks into her keto journey and countless others have asked me how in the world I did it. KETO!

I’m sad that I let myself get that bad. My loose skin is a reminder of that journey. That place I never want to be again. That hell. (Ohh, if anyone has any recommendations for helping to firm up loose skin, please send them my way!!)

So I want to end this saying YOU CAN DO IT! No matter where you are. No matter where you want to be. No matter what obstacles you face. You really can do it. Everyone deserves happiness! Put in the hard work, it gets easier (trust me), and find it! :)

I literally don’t have the slightest clue why I’m suddenly gaining weight. It makes no sense. I realize I wouldn’t be losing as much weight as I already lost quite a bit. But I certainly didn’t expect gaining.
Is this normal? Should I be doing anything different now that I’m on a lower body weight compared to when I started? Any advice is appreciated&lt;/p&gt;

All this to say, if you have decided to make this change you will not regret it!  Don't look at as a ""diet"" to lose some weight, but truly a life changing way of fueling your body.  I know when you get to your goal weight you will never want to go back to your old way of eating.

,keto,"Hi everybody,

I started suppressing carbs from my food one year ago, not even knowing i was doing keto, just because i felt so good without it. I think i was eating between 20-50 grams of carbs per day.

9 months ago, dry eyes started, and 15 days ago i had severe dry mouth and nose too.

As soon as i understood what happened, I did eat again carbs (120 grams per day) to solve the problem (12 days ago), mouth and a little bit the nose feel better. 

But the eyes still worsen everyday. I try to take some electrolytes since a few days, but can't take much because of kidney stones. I drink a lot, but no improvement.

Any advice or testimony about the time it took for you to feel better ? As I really worry :-((

,keto,"This is Day 12 of Keto. I'm 55F

Carbs: Mostly sticking to 20 (for the last week, prior was around 40), sometimes 26 or so.Eating: Eggs, avocado, some type of fish, some type of green vegetable, sometimes chicken. No sugar.Calories: Around 1000 to 1400.IF: I'm also eating in a 4 to 6 hour window.Electrolytes: I'm very hydrated, drinking 3 to 4 32oz tumblers of water with electrolyte powder that equals 750mg to 1000mg of potassium, plus I am adding in salt and my tracker shows I'm getting about 4500 or so of sodium and 1500 or so of potassium. I added in a bit more potassium yesterday with No Salt. I'm getting 300mg magnesium from my water but also did order some magnesium glycinate that will be here today.

1st issue: I am still going through dizziness, that need to breathe in a full breath of air (I have had a full heart workup recently and my heart is fine) but the hyperventilating is driving me crazy. I even wake up with that sense that I need a full breath. I thought it was just anxiety (something I do have, but not usually over breathing), but last night I was calm, I had even taken a .5 xanax but got very dizzy (hours after eating), and as a result I have headaches.

There ends up this weird sense of cortisol/adrenaline that I have gotten before. Sometimes hot flashes. I had some chest discomfort and random heart palpitations going on as well. I even gave in last night and had some peanut butter in case it was low blood sugar. I can't really tell if that helped. Today it is a lot of dizziness when I get up and walk around.

I've been pushing through this because I FEEL BETTER in all other ways. A lot of my pain is gone. I don't want to give this up but it's driving me crazy to be in this state of breath and dizziness and palps. I did see my doctor virtually but they can't do any blood panel or check labs for several weeks.

2nd issue: I'm very overweight. I have hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's, Adult Human Growth Hormone Deficiency (take injections for that), and border on pre-diabetes. I have at least 100 pounds to lose. I was 281 when this all started and though it's gone down maybe to 280, one time 279 I'm still 280/281 most of the time. I haven't lost hardly one pound at all. I FEEL like I'm a bit lighter but I have so far to go, I don't understand why there's not even a 2 pound difference in almost 2 weeks.

I have some limited mobility with being able to walk without having to stop due to some stenosis and I have no car. So I am very inactive up on the 3rd floor of my apartment. I have not exercised much due to the dizziness though I was doing my treadmill and some qigong and floor exercises before.

I don't want to give this up. I literally had my family come help me clear out my fridge and pantry the other day of anything non-Keto, that is how committed I have been to this but this anxious/awful state of being and lack of any weight loss is extremely discouraging. I'm already battling some depression.

I need this to work. My health has stopped me from living any type of life for years now. I only have until the end of this year to be healthy and financially independent again (my family is helping me right now). The pressure is huge and I can't fail. No other way of eating has helped the REST of me feel better how this has. ANY advice, encouragement, insights greatly appreciated.

TLDR: Dizzy, sometime heart palpitations, over-breathing. Not losing any weight for almost 2 weeks of starting. Feeling better in all other ways. More energy most of the time, but today feeling extremely disheartened because nothing I've done is taking away this feeling or causing me to lose weight so far.",t2_4sdb0dc5,False,,0,False,Beyond frustrated and want to cry today,[],r/keto,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_13n1jv3,False,dark,0.54,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,1684610392.0,,[],{},,True,,1684605427.0,text,6,,,text,self.keto,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Day 12 of Keto.

,keto,"Just wanted to tell r/Keto that I just hit 198.7 lbs!

My starting weight was only 213 lbs., 5 weeks ago.  And it's been super easy to follow the diet.  I used to keto before COVID, and quit due to...(waves arms)…everything. My last run of keto (over a year long) had me down to about 180 lbs., a weight where I had some body fat, but looked decent without a shirt on in the pool (pot bellies are a family trait and embarrassing as hell for me).

**BACKSTORY:**  Wife and I are finally financially ""stable"" and doing well in a new, larger, house, most debts paid down, feeling good about life.  In the first week of April, we decided to go to Cancun on a Honeymoon luxury package (we never had a honeymoon, we've also never gone on vacation just the 2 of us, either her parents were in the next room, or the kids were).  After 26 years, we decided it was time for a honeymoon!  So we got our packages all set up for a July 1 trip.  We were both SUPER excited and ready to go, but then my wife popped up, ""but we're so fat now...""  This is true, we both gained like 30 lbs. since 2019, not moving, not eating right, working from home, we got fat and lazy.  I went from a size 32 to a size 36!  She had similar issues, all new wardrobe, 2 or even 3 sizes larger.

So, I said, ""well, if you want to lose weight, you KNOW Keto worked for me, and it's SUPER fast vs. just eating less,"" (I'd lost 40 lbs. in less than 6 months before, then packed on 10 lbs. more of muscle at the gym).  She NEVER liked Keto, thought it was stupid and all bacon and butter coffee.  I picked up a couple of cook books and made her some test meals (spicy brussels sprouts and Asian salmon, Texas chili, gochujang roasted chicken, etc...).  She said she could eat that.  So, convinced, we started our journey a week later.  She still misses her potatoes, PB sandwiches, and pasta.  To make it a bit easier for her, I got some Keto 1 Carb Bread and some sugar-free PB for a 1/2 sandwich when she's craving hard.  She loves it, it's only about 4 Carbs when she has that, so that's a pretty good snack. She's down about 10 lbs. too but she always has a problem losing weight, it's REALLY hard for her to count calories or work out in any way besides Yoga, she just doesn't have the mentality.

We've not added too much exercise yet, just some walking here and there, and are about to start daily walks for an hour or more, so progress will improve even more. I'm about to start a morning routine in my office with bands (thanks Buff Dudes!), but I'm not going to stress it too much, I'm getting too old for heavy lifting, going to go more light lifting/cardio.  Maybe 30 min/day M-F.

**TODAY:** Anyway, It's a small victory, compared to some of you who have struggled with obesity your whole life or started higher. You guys are the real heroes.  But, to me, it's a big win, I'm finally starting to feel better. My IBS is all but gone (maybe one day a month is rough).  We're both down a full size, and then a bit.  Like, I'm a 33 (if they made such a size). Large T-Shirts fit again, without stretching on my gut.  I'm personally down from around 34.6% body fat to 31.6%, so that's a big loss right there for me, feeling good about that.  The wife's been stuck at 129-ish for the last week, but her Body Fat % has dropped a full percentage in that time, my guess is the increased protein has given her a bit more muscle mass (She never ate a lot of protein, she's always lived on carbs almost exclusively).

OH, and I got my blood checked right after we started.  CRAZY results that day (never been that bad), I'm hoping things REALLY get better soon.  In 2019, my cholesterol was 201, I was higher normal for HDL, but low on LDL (or something like that).  Here's the ""before"" results:

* High Blood Pressure - medication prescribed, eek!!! Dr. and I are hoping 20 lbs. total loss will help this without meds needed in the future.
* cholesterol, total: 207
* HDL cholesterol 37
* LDL-cholesterol 152
* chol/HDLC ratio 5.6
* non HDL cholesterol 170

I've got a follow-up in late July, after Cancun, I'm sure those results will be better, though I plan to have most of my blood replaced with tequila before I get back.  :-D",t2_4kk7f,False,,0,False,"Onederland!!!

Not feeling like working out, eating lots of artificial sweeteners/processed foods to fill whatever void, and have not been able to recommit to tracking everything like I was before. I'm not gaining any weight, but sure as shit haven't lost any either.

However, I went on a vacation at the end of March into April and got a little lax... exercised the whole time but ate a little cheat-y (not terribly, but a little), and didn&amp;#39;t track a thing. I only gained a few pounds, and was able to knock those off pretty quickly when we got home. Since then, though, I have been in a MAJOR rut. Not feeling like working out, eating lots of artificial sweeteners/processed foods to fill whatever void, and have not been able to recommit to tracking everything like I was before. I&amp;#39;m not gaining any weight, but sure as shit haven&amp;#39;t lost any either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just recommitting to cleaner eating, macro tracking, and getting back into the gym and running. Wanted to post for accountability, and because I love the energy here most of the time and appreciate all the support I have gotten so far! Happy keto-ing and thanks for the support!&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"I’ve heard this and so I haven’t been eating much fat. I don’t really count my macros because that kinda pushes me towards eating disorder territory but my basic lunch is a lettuce wrapped sandwich, some veggies with ranch, a protein bar, sometimes about a 1/4 cup of blueberries and that’s usually it for lunch. Breakfast is usually pretty light snacks. And then supper varies but it’s not usually anything super fatty, mainly protein based. My herbalist recommended I do intermittent fasting and told me a good eating window for me would be 1-9pm but that’s really hard for me to maintain when I feel super hungry in the morning and work around food all day. I could try to do 11am-7pm and that would probably work better cuz I find I don’t get very hungry in the evening. But I’m wondering if I should be eating more fat? I’m just not losing as fast as I want to and as fast as I feel I could. 

Some background, I’ve done keto before and it’s worked great for me. First time I was at 160lbs and went down to about 130, second time I was about 145lbs and went down to about 120-125 at my lowest but my body maintained a good 130lb range naturally after I stopped keto. But then I got pregnant and I’ve been dying to get my body back. I don’t have low self esteem but I just hate not recognizing myself for over a year. I’m an early 20s female, 14 months post partum (finished with breastfeeding and all that) I’m 5’1” and currently weight 178 lbs. My heaviest was about 194 lbs. I can’t believe how close I was to 200lbs at one point on my short little frame. My thyroid issues and lactation hormones that I was producing simply refused to allow me to do anything OTHER than gain weight. I did keto again between February-January which helped me stop lactating and get my period back but didn’t make me lose much weight. But once I wasn’t lactating, I was gradually able to drop about 8 lbs without really doing anything different with diet. 

This time around, I started on May 5th and weighed around 184lbs I think (hard to know for sure because my scale was super old and kinda inaccurate but I bought a new digital one so I’ll have much more accurate reading from now on) anyway, my morning and evening weighing fluctuate a ton but so far my evening weigh ins have shown that I haven’t lost more than 10 lbs yet. And I feel like I should have lost at least that much by now, especially since I walk and stand ALL. DAY. Idk I’m just frustrated I guess. WHY can’t my body just do what I want it to lol. I could count my macros more closely, but like I said, it becomes a bit mentally unhealthy for me if I do. I’m considering just trying to calculate a full day’s worth of macros and just eat those same things day in and day out until I get the results I want. Has anyone tried that and did it work? I hate cooking and thinking of new stuff to make (even though I went to school for it and it’s my job lol) so that might be good for me anyway if I can make it balanced enough.

Edit: lots of good tips in here thank you. Yes I’ve found that any “keto” labeled snacks tend to slow me down but it’s hard to put them off when they help me to not be tempted by other non keto sweets. I think what I’ll do is just save any “keto” labelled sweets until there are people around me who are eating desserts. Like on Mother’s Day my family had a beautiful pavlova cake so I ate one of those Enlightened brand ice cream bars and it helped me not feel left out without going out of ketosis. So I’ll save treats for stuff like that. I’ll also stop weighing so often and just focus on good whole food proteins and moderate fats.

,keto,"Hi everyone! I’ve posted here a few times already. I’m maintaining a 60lbs weight loss and I’m proud of the work I’ve done. Just had my 2 year ketoversary on May 1. 

I haven’t lost any significant weight for about a year. I’ve been playing ping pong with the same 5lbs and have been between 140 and 145 depending. 

I know the reason I haven’t lost is because I cannot for the life of me make keto work at my 15-20% deficit (around 1200 per the calculator). I’d love to see low 130s, and know that it will take restriction and focus. 

Sometimes I can do 3-4 days in a row at 1100-1200 cals and then completely blow it with too much fat or needlessly grazing. 

I do believe this is a mental issue right now. 145lbs was my goal weight from the beginning, because it’s what I weighed before (I let) insulin resistance ruin my life. Once I hit that weight, I kind of stopped being so motivated. The issue is I don’t physically look like I used to at this weight many years ago - I still have a bit of a stomach I’d like to eliminate. 

I need motivation to finally get it done.  Any realistic tips that don’t require OMAD fasts? Meals that are lower in calories but satiating?

,keto,"Hi everyone,

As the title suggests, the different nutrition labelling we have here in the EU is causing me some confusion, especially when I read keto advice written on US websites. 

Here is an example of an EU label:

Energy                           203kcal

Fat.                                 3.3g

(of which saturates)    0.3g

Carbohydrate                34.2g

(of which sugars).         0.5g

Fibre.                              10.3g

Protein.                           3.8g

Salt.                                 1.12g

         
Taking the example shown, can someone help me figure out which carb number I should be counting? The top one (carbohydrates) or the lower one (of which sugars)?

,keto,"Hello everyone. Thought I would ask the community something that has had me thinking as Im going back to another round of keto,  


So not too much of a stranger to it, know the concept of it and such and had some various success with it, and mostly other reasons that hindered my continued progress.  For more context, a recent checkup shows higher fatty acids in the bloodstream, and overweight along with some fatty liver, and few good years of continous stress which thankfully that is getting better taken care of.  


Since 2022, I been supplementing with whataver I can based on simplicity or price, as in apple cider vinegar tablets since cant handle too well natural, not a fan at all of fish so omega 3 tablets, extra combos of ALA,CLA, Cinnamon, everything one can almost think of to take (in moderation ofcourse) to keep blood sugar in check ( long term seems fine though), and I mostly contribute the blood fats to a longer stay abroad along with ofcourse overweight and fatty liver.   


While doctors claim T2D ( taking metformin), I pretty sure its mostly pre-diabetes as the first test was taken shortly after being abroad with 30 days of constant fruit juicing, so obviously has some influence and the doctor had no regard for it at all .  


Previously also managed to exercise abit everyday in the morning ( threadmill or outside 20-30 min), which has yielded results in some weight loss, but after broad, it mostly bounced back up, so some advice will be helpful to mucle build/weight loss. Read that weight handles combined with simple walking works well.  


But as I am back to start again, I wanted to maybe hear of the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1: Morning routine now consists of taking the standards of the morning such as ACV, ALA, pretty much anything that can be taken in the morning to combat both the dawn effect and get ready to exercise about 30-45-60 min after waking up.  
Advice on pills/routine to kickstart the day in terms of weight loss, muscle, sugar ?

I am starting to intend to take protein powder before exercise/meal regardless if doing a workout or not, so for that reason I assume whey protein would work best pre-workout, or any other recommended ? (isolate more expensive...). Also saw conflicting info about too much protein (powders) being rough on the kidneys while other studies have no correlation, and I'm both a veggie and carnivore at heart.  


2: Slowly having adapted by having a few days only two meals with chicken, avocado and shirataki, along with olive oil, mix of seeds and potentially some leaf salads occasionally, with an eating window of about 9-10 to 14-15, trying to have about 4-5 as saw references that residual insulin from previous if timed well, can help ofcourse with next meal to piggy back on. Almost felt like my body was down memory lane,  as the next day I neither was hungry and didn´t feel (again or as much), general cravings for carbs  or any third meal after a certain time.  


So if trying to stick to as simple ingredients and meal prep as possible, anything other to change based on the above combo ? Ofcourse based on price and recipe, I substitute chicken for any other kind of meat, any similar alternative to avocado ?  


3:  Trying to still atleast feel that Im alive and eating and not eating to stay alive haha, I started to try out a pea protein shake ( vanilla flavoured so minor difference in content compared to pure),  as I had a similar shake before that not just helped to get me through it, but I guess confirmed for me that the pea protein works.  


Any other protein that would be better after a meal/workout (apart from whey) ? I previously also found one based on a proteinmix of pea, sunflower and pumpkin, would that have a perhaps better efficient combo compared to just pea protein ?  


That combo is more expensive, but is also fairy free, vegan, no added sugar, natural flavored ( berry/chocolate option), and 64 % protein per 100 gram, worth investing in such combo compared to any other higher in protein or would be enough ? Also very very low carb, hence in terms of composition, flavor and price, hope to have.  


4: Here is a little devil I been meaning to deal with, and that is the essence of keto itself, the dark side.... carbs. As much as anyone may perhaps get a cheat meal of home fries, bread or similar, I found the willpower to even dodge those, and after an investment in a new "" oven fryer"" that works wonders, in order to encourage to eat and avoid cheat meals, so far my go to carb veggie has been harricot verts.

Especially for price, nutrition, fiber and to complement what otherwise might feel morning with just  meat avocado shirataki combo, my questions remains into what carb blockers do you recommend, and is digestive enzymes an advantage to have ?  


I have previously gotten white kidney bean extract, and wish to ask if anyone has felt or noticed ( perhaps better monitored with continuous or app readings) how much of a real life difference they make and dose dependant. My dosage before meal is one pill at 5000 mg according to the pack, but sometimes it feels like if I want to have more of anything with carbs, if would be enough or need double.  


Also, I have gotten great results in terms of satiety, weight loss in general, thanks to both air popped popcorn, and after a recent purchase of small kettle popcorn set, used 1-2 spoons of coconut oil for them. But as only a full bowl mostly has the best effect on me, is the white kidney bean enough to block half of more of it ?

Do you count the carb per weight before or after popped ? Any other carb blocker before/after recommended so one can still have low carb veggies along with potentially popcorn to help maintain to be under best case scenario 20 g/50g.  


Since coconut oil (despite MCT and such, more below),  is in general a worse fat for daily use, I only use it for the popcorn 1-2 times a day, olive oil for fry or salad, and on occasion avocado oil when something cant be had due to recipe or no avocado.  


Thus considered sesame oil to replace the coconut oil for the popcorn. Options ?

  
5: Dairy. This has given me a headache, because who doesnt love it or try to incorporate it easily ? I read that green tea interacts badly with the dairy protein, thus I tried my best to have green tea roughly 2 hours after, but sometimes very hard to stick to in timings, especially if having second meal soon enough so its also 2 hours apart. Now I recently seen that its not just dairy protein but all protein.  


So I guess the new rule of thumb is any tea 2 hours after food ? I assume then that this also applies to whey/pea/any protein powder. Count from first/last bite ?

6: As for desserts, due to dairy options, I try to stick to greek yoghurt, with a mix in of stevia, monkfruit, raw cocoa powder, sometimes abit unfrozen berries ( mix or solely raspberry, blueberry, strawberry) as toppings, half to full cup. Full fat yoghurt version to avoid the extra carbs.  But also with cottage cheese has gotten great results, so more worth it with one, both, cycle through them ?  


Also due to ofcourse as always, calories in and out matters, so trying to get as much foodmass as possible with the least calories up to about   


7: After food, a square of pure unsweeted dark chocolate and a spoon of MCT. Thought on mct mixes or stick to only C8 ? Thought mixes might have its advantages also thanks to the C12 one, experience on best option ?

8: After meal, few pills again of ACV, ALA and more to handle any sugar spikes, along with multi/B vitamins and such. Any supplement highly recommended ?  


9:  Inbetween the meals and after, 2 hours apart and after, splash of lime juice (lemon same effect ? hard to come by...) a combo of green/black tea and chamomille cold jug, about 600 ml. On occasion might add a splash of natural flavoring ( sukralose + stevia). No sodas, coffee (green coffee pills) or other drinks. 

10: Before bed or hours before, taking certain supplements to help with sleep, fat burn and similar, anything recommended ? Getting for now 8 hours of sleep.  


As for calories, wise to start lowest and once metabolism slows down, slowly make my way back up, or do the reverse to get the body adjusted before reaching a stalemate and getting back up again instantly or slowly again max to 2000 calories ?

,keto,"Hi Everyone,

I’m 4.5 weeks into keto and think I could be feeling better. Wondering if I’m just not yet fat/keto adapted yet. I am a 170 lbs male, 34 years old. My electrolytes are on point as I track everything (I’ve based everything off the FAQ here on Reddit) and take a magnesium supplement at night. Fat is high and sufficient as well (170-190g/day) as I am not trying to lose weight at this point until I am fully adapted and feeling better before cutting calories. Protein typically ranges anywhere from 100-130g/day. I am always well below 20g carbs per day as I track every single thing possible. I have been doing 18/6 IF for several weeks prior to starting keto and continued into keto as well and have been following the same IF schedule.

Could this just be a case of not being adapted yet? Another thing is I use a Whoop to track recovery (I don’t put too much stock it in to be honest at this point regarding keto) but over the last 3 weeks or so my recovery has been far lower than ever before and my HRV is half of what it was prior to keto.

I have read that this will happen for the first few weeks and then once your body adapts everything gets back on track. I guess my question is, has anyone experienced several weeks until adapted of just not feeling great and then one day everything changes?

,keto,"Today is the end of my first month on keto and it’s been a fairly successful month (28 days), so I thought I’d share what I’ve done and the process.  
  
Male, 48 years old, 194 cm, starting weight 122 kg (269 lbs), current weight 112.1 kg (247.1 lbs) which is a loss of 9.90kg (21.8 lbs)  
  
This isn’t my first time on the keto diet and I consider myself fairly well informed on the hypothesis and science that underlies it, and as someone who has repeatedly done the diet over the last twelve years I think I have a good handle on what works for me and what doesn’t. The losing weight part of keto is quite easy for me, the maintenance phase however I have never been able to....maintain. :)  
  
  
  
**Diet has been made up of the following:**  
  
Meat, All kinds but a large proportion of chicken and pork. Fattier cuts like thighs, belly preferred.  
  
Dairy: Eggs, butter and double cream (heavy cream).  
  
Fruit Veg: Avocado, Broccoli, Cucumber, Gherkins, Strawberries.  
  
Nuts: Peanuts (dry roasted), but I've switched over to Pecans and Macadamia nuts as they are better in a number of ways.  
  
Fish: Salmon, Cod and Squid.  
  
Drink: Water accounts for 50% of my fluid intake, coffee 35%. The remainder is tea / herb tea / Bovril. I avoid sugared drinks like the plague and sparingly drink diet soda. No alcohol.  
  
Oils and Fats: Lard, Coconut oil, Olive oil, Butter. No seed oils except in tiny quantities.  
  
I've very much concentrated on electrolytes to combat fatigue from exercising and cramp while swimming. Something I have suffered with since childhood, swimming gives me foot/calf cramps. No other exercise makes me cramp, not running, squash, football...nothing. The electrolytes certainly help with the fatigue, but I can't see much improvement with cramping.  
  
I eat almost no processed food. I cook from fresh ingredients almost entirely. I pay little attention to organic over regular produce unless the price is similar.  
  
Average calories eaten over the four weeks were 1,377 and the carbs 26g gross, 20g net.  
  
  
  
**Other actions and stats.**  
  
Exercise: Moderate at between 2,500 and 5,500 calories per week. Over the whole month I have hit 15,000 ckals. This is made up of 30 minute swims, hour long saunas, walking for 20-30 minutes and cycling for an hour. There's other bits and pieces in there, but these four are my main exercises.  
  
Fasting: I’m OMAD most days, sometimes this can drop down to a mid afternoon snack and then evening meal. I very rarely eat before 2pm or after 7pm.  
  
Blood Pressure and pulse: I decide to monitor blood pressure this time around and in the 4 weeks I have moved from a starting pressure of 133/77 to a last week average of 124/75. Resting pulse rate started at 66 and now hovers at 55 on average.  
  
Blood Sugar: This is perhaps where I have seen the least progress while in ketosis. Starting with some measurements prior to beginning the diet I was showing in the 7-9 mmol range. Once into ketosis I've been pretty steadily recording in the range of 6.1 - 6.6. This is obviously a drop from the non keto life, but it's still higher than most sources claim as healthy and higher than I have previously achieved. I am unsure why this is, but I hop it will change as the weeks progress.  
  
  
  
**Some of the metrics of progress this month have been:**  
  
9.90 kg of weight lost.  
  
Circumference of chest reduced by 6cm, belly by 9cm, waist by 5cm, thigh by 3cm.  
  
BMI has dropped by 2.6 points.  
  
Acid reflux went away within 36 hours of starting the diet.  
  
I’m fitter as a result of the exercise and I am improving here quite nicely. As an aside, I was exercising while not on keto and gaining weight.  
  
Visits to the toilet lowered from 4+ to 1 per day.  
  
Before starting the diet I was experiencing very low energy, this is now no longer a problem.  
  
Sleep quality while not terrible before, is significantly better.  
  
Hunger is completely under control and not subject to any cravings.  
  
Various inflamed / sore areas such a ribs, elbows have been greatly alleviated.  
  
Mood is very much improved. Mental clarity is sharper and clearer.  
  
It’s always interesting to get onto a ketogenic diet and experience the immense positive effect it has on me. As always I am determined to continue, but I do have something of a history of stopping at around three months. Typically this is due to the influence of family life and events rather than my own absence of desire, or need to quit. I hope to remain focused on this and persevere, simply put the benefits are so dramatic for me in weight loss and health that it’s really quite stupid to stop.

,keto,"I used to be 160 pounds and 5’11 tall. I had to change to keto diet for my extremely physical demanding job, with minimal amount of breaks. I did keto for the sake of better energy and endurance. 

So… I have been extremely physical and working so hard on my job for past 6 weeks. Energy was amazing. My brain got tired before my body did! Lol!

Sooo… I ate a ton of heavy whipping cream puddings with peanut butter. Steaks. Eggs. Avocados. Cheese. I end my day with delicious desert of heavy whipped cream with some berries and nuts mixed up. Also, I only drink water with sometimes 1 cup of milk a day. 

I don’t know how much calories they all add up, they are very big portions. Lol. I think I have been eating 3,000 to 3,500 calories everyday. 

I didn’t have much cheat days. Nothing. So, fast forward 2 months…

I noticed that my arms, my torso somewhat look more manly. My belly looks just the same, I still got the same sweet ol six pack. Not 8, there’s some belly rolls when I sit down. My belly is pretty much the same compared before and after. 

But it just seems like my body somewhat look more manly now. So I checked my weight. Oh wow, 172 pounds. I gained a little bit more than 10 pounds in 2 months. 

It looks like I gained some muscular mass without even hitting gym… well, my physical job… could count as a gym lol yeah.

I had to change to keto diet for my extremely physical demanding job, with minimal amount of breaks. I did keto for the sake of better energy and endurance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… I have been extremely physical and working so hard on my job for past 6 weeks. Energy was amazing. My brain got tired before my body did! Lol!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sooo… I ate a ton of heavy whipping cream puddings with peanut butter. Steaks. Eggs. Avocados. Cheese. I end my day with delicious desert of heavy whipped cream with some berries and nuts mixed up. Also, I only drink water with sometimes 1 cup of milk a day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how much calories they all add up, they are very big portions. Lol. I think I have been eating 3,000 to 3,500 calories everyday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have much cheat days. Nothing. So, fast forward 2 months…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that my arms, my torso somewhat look more manly. My belly looks just the same, I still got the same sweet ol six pack. Not 8, there’s some belly rolls when I sit down. My belly is pretty much the same compared before and after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it just seems like my body somewhat look more manly now. So I checked my weight. Oh wow, 172 pounds. I gained a little bit more than 10 pounds in 2 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like I gained some muscular mass without even hitting gym… well, my physical job… could count as a gym lol yeah. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"Just wanted to start a discussion on this.

I'm sensitive to osmotic diarrhea from excessive electrolyte intake. I'm fine if I sip ketoade and dilute it enough, but I wanted some more wiggle room because I still run into this issue every so often. A while back, I took some Alka-Seltzer and just happened to read the label. Apparently it has an entire gram of sodium in it!

I thought that was odd, because it didn't give me any bathroom difficulties after chugging it with just a few ounces of water.

So I researched, and apparently in Alka-Seltzer, the ingredients sodium bicarbonate and citrate combine into *sodium citrate*. That chemical reaction is what makes the bubbles. Neat, right? Anyways...

Sodium citrate is sodium bound to citrate (obviously). There's three forms. Mono, di, and tri-sodium citrate. Each with one more sodium atom attached. Looking through Wikipedia, tri-sodium citrate seemed the most ideal, so I bought some on amazon for cheap, and have been using it in my ketoade.

It's way better than store-bought salt, in my opinion. It has very little taste when added to water. It ends up being maybe very slightly salty and mineral-y. Just a little odd, but not gross. And it's totally covered up by even the barest of flavoring. It's potent, too. One teaspoon has 1.4 grams of sodium in it.

So, I decided today to risk a few hours on the toilet. I intentionally drank a higher amount quickly. One teaspoon in 8oz of water, finished in a minute. And...

No issues. I was fine for the whole day. And that was on an empty stomach.

Obviously, this was just one attempt at one time but, I figured I'd make a thread so other people can see this, in case it's helpful.

I'm also going to see if there's a better form of potassium I can buy, too. Because that would complete the trifecta of bathroom-proof electrolytes, with sodium citrate and magnesium glycinate.

(P.S. No need to warn me. I don't plan to experiment with chugging potassium lol)

been reading why keto helps so many people and it seems scientists are still trying to pin down the specific reasons. 

One of the reasons they claim is that works is that migraines are related the same kind of irritation that occurs in the brain in epilepsy and migralepsy, ketones help control overactive brain activity. 

Some papers cite that migraines stop because of ketos action of lowering inflammation, (due to the lower amount of insulin in the body.) 

Others cite the fact that, for the brain,  glucolysis is insufficient source of energy, due to insulin resistance, and the ketolysis process provides brain with a much more accessible energy source. Thus, with keto the brain isnt starved. 

It could be a mix of all these mechanisms plus more (such as balanced hormones for women with PCOS) but the fact is its the only thing that helps me completely eliminate my daily persistent migraine. 

Just wanted to add my voice to the conversation, (apologies that i haven’t added the studies but Im you can access them with a few good keywords on google scholar)

,keto,"Hello everyone! 

So I’m really struggling and I could use some advice or input. I’ve always been on weight loss journey’s however, this is the first time that I feel I have actually ever stuck to anything. I’m 4’11 f 28 yo and I started this journey one month and one week ago at 212 pounds. This morning I weighed myself and I weighed in at 196.20. During my period I definitely gained some weight and now that I am off of it as of today, I am back to the weight that I was when I first started my period. This entire process for me is very discouraging and it’s only my own fault and the reason why I’ve quit every thing I’ve ever done.. I really struggle with instant gratification. I’m one of those people that believe eating right and working out will result in 50 pounds lost overnight and I really am trying to train my brain not to think that way. 

The point that I’m trying to make is I’m one month in and I’m really struggling to notice any kind of weight loss in the mirror I know the scale is going down but I just don’t see it. I’m going on a trip at the end of August and I really wanted to lose at least 50 pounds since my start date. Is it possible? When did you actually start seeing yourself slim down in the mirror? How have you overcame body dysmorphia? I am being really strict about my macros and not going over them except for a little bit over my protein goal. I also try and eat clean for the most part, I’ll eat a low-carb tortilla maybe once a week and I eat minimal dairy and I also work out three times a week by doing cardio and strength training.

,keto,"Hey all,
I'm currently on week 6 of Keto and I've been doing it as below 20g carbs, not below 20g net carbs. This means many days I average below 10g net carbs. I'm using MFP to track precisely. It was intentional to choose below 20 total, not net, thought I'd jump into it hardcore. 
The keto flu and irritability were quite minor and only persisted the first week. 
After that, the following 3-4 weeks have been fine. I've felt pretty good. 
However, mid week-5 I started to feel seriously, seriously depressed. The cannot-function-hardly-leave-the-bed-kind of depressed. 
I'm a psychologist so I can delineate whether it's due to strssors in my life vs due to physiological/hormonal changes. 
I'm 27F and not in a part of my cycle where I should be feeling this hormonally (I know what that feels like, too and when in my cycle that happens) 
So today, I did 20g net carbs. Ate some strawberries, ended up approx 44g carbs. I immediately felt a small fog lift - although I still feel a little low mood-wise, I'm significantly better than the past week or so. 
Has anybody else experienced this or have any insights re this?

,keto,"Hi everyone, just over a month of keto diet and I'm in need of serious help. 
Briefly I have been struggling after antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors and now I have FODMAP  sensitivity with years long of digestive issues.
- Started with carnivore/elimination where most of my problems were gone: bloating, sleep got better and gained back some libido. After 2 weeks i started introducing some carbs and fiber, some of the problems are back but very managable. I'm still very fatigued and lost body fat even though I maintained muscle (I work out with mid intensity).
Supplements I take: complex Mg, electrolytes, bulletproof prebiotic fiber, bioOptimizers kapex.
Food: mostly grass fed beef, organs, ghee, tallow, olive oil, avocado and avocado oil and low fodmap salads and fruits. Very restricted.
Protein: 2g/weight in kg, around 20-40g carbs and rest is fat.
After a month trace of excess ketones in urine strips and my sleep is not really good.

Questions:
1) Is my diet problematic with regards to keto transition or is it just dead slow for me? Body fat is around 6-7% very low. Should I increase carb? I work out in the mornings - helps a lot keeping my life together. (Coming out of depression)
2) I do sit a lot (job) but now do breaks with spinal movements and squats (ido portal). Is it also problematic to sit too much with regards to being in ketosis? I feel more the urge to move as with previous diets.
3) Got hungry after workouts and overshoot with calories. Would that also be a problem? Or especially overshooting protein % ?

,keto,"So I've seen a few old (4+ years) posts talking about using the keto diet in Cushing's Syndrome / Disease. I'm here to tell you my story of why that may not be a good idea.

There are a few studies on this, but as mentioned in other posts, they show conflicting information. Some studies show the benefits of symptom relief of a very low calorie (600-800) keto diet for cushing's. Others mention that the symptoms relief is often temporary, and may cause delayed diagnosis for the real problem, which is either excess corticosteroid intake or a tumor, usually of the pituitary or adrenal glands. Finally, others even suggest that a keto diet can, at least temporarily, spike your cortisol levels. For those who don't know, cushing's syndrome / disease is a state of inappropriately elevated cortisol levels, so a further spike in this is the exact opposite of what you want. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened to me.

Prior to being diagnosed with cushing's disease, I was misdiagnosed with PCOS, as they have very similar symptoms and PCOS is much more common. As you probably know, keto / low carb works pretty well for weight loss and overall health when you have this, so I thought I'd give it a try. I did a fairly moderate version of this, with 20-25g of carbs per day and 1200-1400 calories, and managed to go from 219 to 204 lbs in about a month. Sounds great right? Wrong. I felt miserably tired and sick, longer than the 2-3 weeks you'd expect for ""keto flu"". I was also constantly stressed out, even when nothing stressful was happening in my life. I was undergoing screening at the time for other things that I could have that would masquerade as PCOS, so I had to do a urinary free cortisol test. When I did, it was shocking: my cortisol levels were more than twice the upper limit (505 nmol/day, when the limit of that lab was 230). Obviously, this was all because I had a tumor, right? Well, not completely. As part of screening for this disease, you have to repeat this cortisol testing. Between my repeat test and the first one, I stopped the keto diet, figuring it wasn't PCOS causing my symptoms so it would be less beneficial. Not only did I feel a bit better and less stressed, my cortisol levels dropped to 320. This is still too high obviously, but better than it was, and I feel like the lower cortisol led to most of my symptom relief. 

All of this is to say that while keto may work well for similar metabolic issues, it might not be a great idea for this particular one. If you really want to try it and your cause is a tumor, I'd say to wait until after surgery. This is because you usually have the opposite problem for a while: your pituitary or adrenal glands have to heal, and thus you will not have enough cortisol, so the spike might actually be beneficial. However, I can say anecdotally that you will probably lose weight anyway due to the low cortisol, albeit at a slower rate than you might like: I've lost another 15 pounds 3 months post-surgery, just from an unintentional calorie deficit, because low cortisol makes you significantly less hungry.

I've started Keto as I needed to make big changes (pardon the pun). I've ballooned in weight since the covid lock down and now sit at 274 lbs from about 216 lbs. Still 6 ft, though 😂. Lockdown wasn't to blame as much as I'd like to blame it, but in reality, it was all me being food stupid. The initial goal is to lose 28lbs so I can be considered light enough to join my son on a tree top adventure activity when we go on holiday in August. Feel though that's a reasonable goal.

The first 2 days were actually OK eating just salad and salmon + veg. Day 3 I was a bit tired. But today. Just wow, do I feel like I've been used as toilet paper for some greasy unwashed sewer dweller.

The head ache, the fatigue, the brain fog. The emotional discomfort. The scales have dropped to 269 lbs, but I understand that's likely all just water. However, it's still providing some level of motivation though dwindling by the minute.

I don't know what I'm looking for by posting here. I don't even know why I am posting here. Just feel like I need to get this moan out of my system, and this seems like a good place to do so.

,keto,"Hopefully you guys know all this stuff already, but here a few tips that have made my life easier.

My food scale is a basic lcd type, with 2 buttons one for grams/lbs, the other is tare. Tare resets the scale to zero, despite what's on it. Very useful. 

I leave a wide mouthed pint glass on mine pretty much all the time. It lets me see the lcd screen much easier than if I've got a plate covering it. The plate goes on the glass, press tare, chuck on the food, easy. I can also put a hot pan on the glass, (never had one break), rather than the plastic scale

Second thing is my butter dish... If I'm making something that needs a repeated small amount of butter (same for coconut /olive oil) I weigh the   whole butter dish and block at the start(A) , write that with a dry wipe marker on the fridge. After I finished cooking, reweigh (B) , do the math(A-B) , Viola, one measurement for the 4 different chunks of butter I used for keto pancakes this afternoon. You can also do it for the entire day. Weigh your mayo jars, block of cheese, butter, oil at the start, jot it on your fridge, reweigh at the end, Viola, easy record of the stuff you've used. 

Most of my mixing bowls have the gram weight written on their base with a marker. Makes it easier sometimes, although I use tare more often. 

Liquids measured in grams are tricky, One litre of water weighs 1kg. Oil floats on water, it's density is less than 1g/ml. A litre of olive oil weighs 916gram. Base your calculations on that. 
There's not many keto friendly liquids denser than water, it's usually stuff with sugar.

SW: &gt;!268!&lt;CW:&gt;!232!&lt;GW:&gt;!200!&lt;

if you wish to read. (not sure what to pick for flair so success seems fitting)

around February of this year, I was sitting at a good 268 lbs per my last visit with my doctor. We were discussing on types of diets and what could work, and she said a keto diet would be great. I been stuck with sort of eggs and rice as a diet with periods of eating out.

I was also doing a mix of some cardiovascular workouts such as running and walking, and although my energy was decreased, my run times increased due to lost of weight.

We did compared my labs, but I wouldn't say it was too accurate since my previous labs were done last Summer(2022), but I want to say it should of been an ok indicator because I did not change my life style choices until around March.

My routine was a little bland, I would incorporate keto with intermediate fasting and caloric deficit, I know it was an **EXTREME** method of combining all these together, and I would not recommend it to anyone. I was told by my friends that my body could not handle such a program and was doubtful of me. In my head my mind would be stronger than my stomach and body so I could do whatever I put myself through. But I didn't mind their opinions cause I wanted to try it.

I love this type of diet too. I was worried about what my lab results would yield. But at the end of the day my lab results proved me right! Extreme rewards must come from extreme work and sacrifice.

Routine was I fasted all day and worked out in either morning or afternoon, and had a cheap steak with butter and garlic some salt with a tea couple hours before bed. by the end of week 1 I wasn't too bothered by adverse effects of the diet like waking up to use the restroom in the middle of the night, and I felt pretty energized throughout the day when my body was independent from carbs.

Lab Results:

The reference range is mentioning ideal numbers on where I should be.

I don't think its an expensive life style, especially thanks to costco for most of the ingredients, I typically go Sams sometimes in the morning to see if I can catch any steaks on sale too which typically there is. sometimes I can find sales in the small stores like Albertsons/Kroger/Tom Thumb for some nice cuts.

36 lb. drop since February/24 lb. drop since March 16th.

I start my recording my weight around March 16th at 256 lbs, and to my current weight today at May 12th at 232.6 lbs. It feels good to fit in old clothes now, but its not stopping there. I must continue to push forward.

My parents (50M/51F) are very supportive of me losing weight but now I am approaching my goal weight (180) they are telling me to quit because they think I am too thin. For reference, I’m 6’0, currently weigh 192 and have about 20% body fat.

No shade meant to be thrown but my parents have both struggled to lose weight and my thought process is that they are trying to put me down to try to make themselves feel better about not losing weight. 

It’s also worth mentioning I have been decently overweight (210-230) for a majority of my life. Perhaps they just are uncomfortable with how I look now versus how I used to look?

,keto,"My findings is that eating any amount of sugar alcohol above 10g can send you to the bathroom, so I have less than that and am always fine.  However, I was wondering how long it usually takes people to process them so you can have more.   I have had 8 grams at lunch and then had another 8 grams at dinner and that has been fine.  I am looking to hear what everyone has to say without having to do the first hand research here and having to live on a toilet for a while.  Thanks.

,keto,"For context, I'm Male, slightly prediabetic (managed well) and was previously lifting weights + high protein (120-140gram), moderate carb (\~150gram)  and moderate fat (filled in the caloric gap) diet with no sugars. After injuring myself in the gym 3 months ago, I decided to seriously focus on diet and took the plunge into keto + fasting. The main exercise I did for the last 3 months was extended walks 8000+ steps daily.

Since making this change, I've lost 6 kilos from 80kg -&gt; 74kg and body fat percentage dropped from 16% to 14.5% (based on my scale which is probably not accurate but the trend matters).

My keto diet is relatively ""ideal"" along with 16/8 intermittent fasting (didn't count calories). No vegetable oils, high fibre from cruciferous vegetables, less than 20-30grams of carbs daily, no artificial sweeteners (sometimes consume stevia). I eat grass-fed products and fatty fish. My protein intake is probably around 80 grams per day.

Note I also ended a prolonged 86 hour fast a week prior to the blood test (But why would my hbA1C below get so much worse!)

So this week I decided to take a comprehensive blood panel to see how things are going. Surprisingly, most panels have gone to shits from 4 months ago when I was on my old diet/workout routine.

Unchanged:

* HDL: 1.6 

Improvements:

* HOMA-IR: 1.5-&gt;1.3

* Trig: 0.6 -&gt; 1.4 (note that my trig has never gone beyond 0.7 in the past 3 years of blood tests)
* LDL: 3.1 -&gt; 4.3

Very new to keto here. I’ve experimented with IF before but never keto.

My goal isn’t weight loss but more along the lines of improved mental health and general well-being. 

A large part of this is hoping that it might help me as I taper off diazepam and for when I discontinue it completely. I’ve heard of it being really helpful for folks going through alcohol withdrawal due to it’s effect on GABA, and I’m working on the theory that it might help with some of the more debilitating withdrawal effects that I’m experiencing. 

Even if it doesn’t directly correspond to withdrawal, hoping it might make me feel more physically and mentally resilient whilst dealing with withdrawal symptoms.

,keto,"If you disagree with one of these claims then refute it using scientific explanation.

Claims:

1. If you eat more dietary fats and exceed your caloric intake then your body will prioritize the use of the dietary fats to produce energy through Beta oxidation (by using the fatty acids in the dietary fats) and gluconeogenesis ( to make glucose by using the glycerol in the dietary fats). So in order to enter ketosis you must be in a caloric deficit especially in the first few weeks of the the keto diet. Otherwise your body will rely on beta oxidation and gluconeogenesis and that will make you suffer from cravings for carbs because your body will still use glucose for brain energy and will force you to eat carbs by increasing your craving for them.

2. You don't have to eat lots of fats to be in ketosis,  you just need to limit your carbs intake to make it easy for your body to have access to the stored body fats to use them to make ketones in the liver and be in a caloric deficit to force your liver to produce ketones. That's why fasting works very well although you're not eating dietary fats when you fast.

3. Any food you eat (including dietary fats, will promote insulin secretion but indeed it's lesser on fats) so the more frequently you eat the more you're making your body not able to use stored fats for energy because insulin tries to prevent this process.",t2_7ea635b9,False,,0,False,Refute these claims scientifically.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Science and Media'}]",r/keto,False,6,sci,0,,,False,t3_13eircf,False,dark,0.05,,public,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Science and Media,False,0,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1683799329.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.keto,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you disagree with one of these claims then refute it using scientific explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

Not sure why this is a big deal to me, but today I weighed under 225 lbs. I had lingered at 229 to 230 for almost a month, I tried not to worry too much. The ""stall"" started right when I started working out, so I chalked it up to water retention, and my body adjusted to me suddenly asking it to exert itself 5 times a week. But seeing the scale below 225 this morning felt like such an achievement, and it was... but I always feel like I shouldn't make a big deal out of it, like yeah... you should be losing weight... I've always been my own worst enemy, critiquing myself worse than anyone else. 

Yesterday I had a particularly bad day in my workouts, no energy at all... barely made it to 10 minutes in my cardio in the morning when I normally do 45, and my strength training in the afternoon was just as bad. Everyone kept telling me it was the extreme heat (I live in a very, very hot city in Mexico at the moment, called Veracruz, and the heat will knock you out. last Summer two people died of heat exhaustion in the Summer, one of them someone in their 30s--I was mad at myself for ""giving in"" and not completing my exercises... but today I had to remember to be kind to myself, not every day will be 100%.

Anyhow, I also started changing my caloric intake a bit, Monday to Saturday 1300 and Sunday 1500. I read a few articles and posts about how it's good to have a couple of days a week with more calories to prevent stalling. We'll see, I've only done it one Sunday so far. I've also stopped doing OMAD, and have gone to two meals a day, it has helped me greatly with my energy levels, I think because before I wasn't eating at all until after my workout and I was ravenous and exhausted by then, and end up eating a very large meal at around 4:30-5 pm not to mention that with OMAD there were many days were I barely ate 1000 calories. So besides my morning coffee, and the few almonds or small piece of cheese, I'll eat in the day as a snack, it was just my dinner. I feel like for me personally 2 meals are working better. I have my coffee and snack at 9 am after my morning cardio, then my first meal at noon, and my last meal at around 4:30 (before 5 pm) after my afternoon workout with my trainer.

&lt;p&gt;Wondering if keto is playing into that at all or if it&amp;#39;s just the caloric reduction (down from what i assume was over 2600 a day to 1600 consistantly). I know people have a tough time getting enough fiber in but I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s been an issue for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your wonderful responses. I do want to clarify I&amp;#39;m not experiencing discomfort and my stool isn&amp;#39;t what I would consider to be too soft or too hard, just notible to me how much less frequent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The less crap in less crap out makes a ton of sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some made a note about urination and the frequency has dramatically improved as well on diet alone. I used to struggle to make it through a movie at the theather without the urge and I&amp;#39;m going about twice a day now with about a 120 Oz consumption of water! &lt;/p&gt;

* Went from a size 16 to size 14 in my work dress (the 14 is now loose) 
* Now a size M in shirts instead of a L or XL
* I'm a size 12 in jeans, was a 16 when I started and those were tight
* Lost .5 inches in shoes
* my confidence is ridiculously high
* I sleep amazingly
* No acne or oily skin BUT now it's dry so I'm working on that
* haven't lost my boobs/butt which are the first things to go usually
* The numbers are lower but i still need my meds unfortunately. My Dr was impressed with my weight loss tho. He says if I keep it up I could be off the meds in another 2 months if it's not a hereditary thing. 
* People (men) are nicer.

I could go on and on to keep from being kinda irritated with the scale, which is quite ridiculous considering the success I'm having. I'm gonna work out, reflect, take a long walk and start fresh today.

,keto,"For a bit of context, this is my 4th time doing keto. 

The first 3 times I was on keto, I stopped for various reasons, including endless plateaus, a rash caused by insufficient bile resolved by taking bile salts and a horrible rash due to insufficient protein intake resolved by eating more protein on my next attempt after some research.

This time around, I plateau again after the 1st week. I'm counting my calories religiously, lower than 1300 calories a day. I do omad for lunch. I walk 6 times a week. I reduce my calories for a few days, still plateau. I eat the same things every day. 

Incidentally, being a bit depressive, I've come across L-tyrosine and 5-htp as dopamine and serotonin boosters. I start taking them. The morning after, I've lost 1 kilo. And a further 700 g the day after. I google L-tyrosine and 5-htp and sure enough, weight loss is not an uncommon benefit.

I've tested it. On the days I take both amino acids, I lose 500 g to 1 kg a day. When I stop taking them, I don't lose anything.

Anybody has any experience with those amino acids? It's almost too good to be true, but it has improved my mood too. I'm still not taking  them every day as I don't want my body to get used to taking exogenous substances.

I have PCOS and hypothyroidism too, and yet the NHS wouldn’t see me at the weight clinic because I was “too healthy” (not diabetic, no high cholesterol etc) and I was unable to afford a private nutritionist. I then had gastric issues since getting Covid in May last year and have been on the NHS waiting list for investigations since. I was tired of not having money for a doctor and struggling with my weight and gastric symptoms, so I went gluten free a few weeks. It really helped with bloating! But no weightloss.

I started lazy keto on 17th April - counting macros is Not For Me (I am autistic and I can get fixated if I track things). Whole foods, mostly OMAD because my appetite has disappeared. I was doing well - then I had a work thing across three days last week and stopped the diet and took three more days to “cheat” ie not be on keto. I felt SHOCKING - bloated, sore joints, bad memory again. I thought I’d undone my hard work and did gain about four pounds. But unlike previous diets when I fell off the wagon and kind of went “oh well, I failed, never mind”, I went back on keto because it was so easy to do so, and stopped weighing myself every day (to avoid getting despondent). Today was my first weekly weigh in… I’ve lost 15lbs (19lbs if you count the gain/loss of last week haha) in four weeks. No exercise other than usual dog walking.

My thinking is clearer, my energy is higher, I’ve almost booted my coffee addiction (one a day in the morning then herbal teas).

Not really sure why I’m sharing, I’m just so happy to hit this milestone because I haven’t been able to lose weight with calorie counting/low fat/a ton of other diets. Keto is EASY for me and I’m a little in disbelief it’s been working…!

,keto,"I am looking at a can of mushrooms bought from the supermarket where it says that for every 100g of mushrooms (drained) it has 1g of carbs and 2.3g of fiber.

If I understood correctly, in order to calculate net carbs we need to subtract the fiber content to the amount of total carbohydrates in a food. So this would be 1g - 2.3g = -1.3g net carbs 😂

Am I missing something? Could it be that the carbs shown on the nutritional information on the packaging already refer to the net carbs (it doesn't say that, though, it only says carbohydrate)?
