"I feel like going Paleo might be my next step in trying to fix my gut health So far this year I've started to finally pay attention to the things that's wrong with my body. And one of those things being my gut health. Within that I've discovered on my own that I may have leaky gut. And I'm intolerant to gluten, dairy and eggs. Along with a bunch of other things.


So I avoid those three things. While also kind of sticking to low fodmap and mainly avoiding food that causes acid reflux. I've tried diet alike carnivore for a few days and realize that's too extreme for me. I'm at the point also where I've mainly given up all added sugar. I say mainly because I tend to have to restart over but even then my sugar content will be very low.


But the only thing I think left that might be an issue is grains. Like when I went gluten free that pretty much eliminated a good portion of them. Except for rice, corn and certified gluten free oats. I'm at the point where I still can't digest food well and I might suffer from Sibo. Because even things like metamucil that used to work very well for me, just don't do the job any more.


So I think it's time to break things down to a even simpler form. Just getting back to the basics and sticking with food that's not processed but that can still be enjoyable at the end of the day. I think my main hurdle is that I really can't cook well at all. But I'm looking to still give it a go to see if this will bring my gut back to where it needs to be."
"Is artificial sweetener sucralose harmful? üßê There‚Äôs a lot of claims that artificial sweeteners are hurting the microbiome and potentially cause insulin resistance. Most of the studies are done on mice or other animals so I don‚Äôt really trust it. 

Although I always like to dig deeper into the topic so I can understand how certain ingredients impact our bodies and health. 

Do you know any research papers/ studies about sucralose potential side effects or safety that are done on humans? Please spread the knowledge in the comments below üôÇüëç"
"Any good paleo recipes for spaghetti sauce? Or brands? All the stuff I see online has sugar in it, I'd like to avoid if possible.

Also a lot of brands use canola oil or something.... I know ragu uses olive oil instead but it still uses sugar."
"Today's breakfast People often ask what to eat in the morning so [here's my breakfast from this morning](https://i.imgur.com/8sg8K1g.jpg).

* egg frittatas with bacon, red pepper, onion &amp; mushrooms (season as desired w/ salt &amp; pepper or other seasonings)

* raw broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, a wedge of avocado &amp; apples

* cashew yogurt with added fresh (unsweetened) pineapple (I also use plain, unsweetened, whole milk yogurt)

* a latt√© with whole milk (I don't have dairy issues and I have a cappuccino machine)

The frittatas bake in the oven for about 22 minutes at 350¬∞. I use 4 eggs, mix them up good with a little whole milk, add in the veggies &amp; bacon, then bake them in a muffin pan. I use paper muffin pan liners so they are easily removed from the pan. I get 6 frittatas, or 2 breakfasts, with 4 eggs.

This is also a very portable breakfast that I'll bring to work in a tupperware type container. I reheat the frittatas in our work microwave."
"Too Good To Be True Keto Foods Hello Keto Community,

I'm looking to expand my culinary horizons with this post, and hopefully, others will find it useful as well.

Have you ever come across a Keto-friendly food that's so delicious, it seems almost illegal? Think along the lines of Keto Cheesecake ü§Ø 

If you've stumbled upon something that tastes amazing, and surprisingly fits within the Keto guidelines, please share it below. I'm also open to hearing about foods that may seem Keto-friendly, but are actually misleading and should be avoided.

Looking forward to your suggestions. I believe this exchange of information will benefit us all in our Keto journeys."

"Hair concerns I've noticed a difference in my hair since starting keto. Shedding short hairs, change in texture, etc. I've heard keto can cause hair loss if you're losing weight too fast, but I've been pretty gradual with my weight loss. I take a prenatal daily along with a magnesium/calcium/vitamin d combo. Any suggestions on how to make the shedding stop? Any supplements you've found to be helpful?"
"Keto and weight-lifting exercises as a woman, apparently don't mix according to my PT üò© I recently started PT. I train with 3 x week (MWF) in the mornings. With a mix of resistance training (2 days) and conditioning/HIIT style (1day). My macros assigned by her are 1500 calories - 131g protein, 57g fat and 94g carbs. She knows I desperately want to transition to keto to lose 10kg of weight. Except she thinks returning to the gym after a year off, being a woman - the hormonal changes, and the style of exercise program she has created is apparently not suited to keto weight loss. According to her, I will store all the protein, rather than using it as fuel due to lack of aerobic exercises. She thinks all the aerobic exercises would need to have me near out of breath for it to count, since I suggested I could do brisk walks on my non-training days. 

And that I will ultimately reach my end goal on keto - but it will take much longer since I'm not abiding by her assigned macro ratios. Ultimately it's my call, but she's really confused me on what I thought I knew. Can someone help shed some light please on what they recommend starting with? Perhaps sticking with this for a month to kickstart my metabolism and then transition to keto regardless of exercise style."
"Ketosis and spaced out and blurry vision I started keto diet 6 days ago.  I was in ketosis 2 days ago.  Same today.  I had 110g protein yesterday and 40g carbs, which included some brown rice with dinner, olives, a bit of fetta, oil and green salad and broccoli tops.

Since 6:30am I have extremely blurry vision, tinnitus and badly spaced out.  People tell me I look sick and lifeless eyes.  I didn't feel this bad yesterday.

Two extreme bouts of diarrhea yesterday with burning gut.  It was the night before's dinner, salad with 2 avocados and MCT and olive oils.  Bright yellow liquid residue in diarrhea yesterday...probly indicates malabsorption of fats in the oils. The oils burn my guts.  I also get stabbing pains under my right lower rib...

More diarrhea this morning as soon as I got up today at 6:30am.

Keto stick at 2:20pm today (10 minutes ago) was in the middle at 4

.  Still spaced out and huge blurry vision....

I'm doing this keto thing to eliminate

GI pathogens, not lose weight."

"Recent Period Changes? hi everyone! 

i have been working to lose some weight for the past month. i‚Äôve been strength training and trying to watch what i eat. I have lost maybe 2lbs since starting, and I‚Äôve tried to focus on eating more protein and significantly lowering carbs. 

I recently started my period earlier than normal with absolutely 0 PMS symptoms. that never happens to me. Usually I am tired, bloated, feel chest soreness, hungry etc beforehand. Fast forward to today, and I am now on Day 10 of my period and am just a little confused about what is going on, usually I only have it for 7 days. Sorry if this is TMI i am just a little worried. 

Has anyone had this experience?"
"Just hit the one month mark! I am down 9 lbs! I'm assuming it's all water weight right now because my body doesn't look \*too\* different, but I cannot be happier with the benefits that I've had the last 4 weeks!

My SW is 133lbs, I don't really have a specific goal weight I'd say, as I'm wanting to lose fat, but gain some weight back in muscle. Once I hit my goal appearance, I'm thinking of doing keto at a maintenance level until early next year (when my LDR boyfriend moves in with me), but I really wouldn't mind doing it for longer. It's been extremely beneficial.

Here are some of my findings in the the first month of doing keto:

1. My love for food and cooking has been reignited. I've been struggling with binge eating/purging and having a terrible relationship with food for the last 4 years. I'm now eating things like chicken wings, chicken thighs, steak, bacon, cheese, chicharron, chicken skin and eggs. I used to eat strictly egg whites and chicken breast when I was doing low carb &amp; low fat. At first, I was honestly really worried about tracking again as it's such a slippery slope for me, but I've been planning out my meals and tracking everything just fine. My mental health surrounding food has been so much better.
2. I've been sleeping like a fricken baby. I fall asleep within minutes of my head hitting the pillow, and I feel so well rested when I wake up.
3. Grocery shopping is way more streamlined. I have my list for the week, I'm in and out, and not spending money on random snacks.
4. My skin looks soooo good because of all the water I'm drinking.
5. Speaking of water, I've never used Mio before since I like good ol' regular water, and I started using the blueberry lemonade Mio for my ketoade. Mio is so good lol 
6. No bloating! I've been sensitive to something when I ate pizza and pasta but only sometimes. Couldn't figure it out. But now it's not an issue.
7. I'm way less hungry and fasting is much easier. I eat between 12:00 pm and \~6:30 pm and I don't often find the need to snack.
8. I'm eating the most whole foods ever in my life.
9. I've never had such a positive and fun outlook on a big lifestyle change.

The cons list is short- my performance at the gym is still hindered and I get hella sugar cravings. I'm still probably not fully fat adapted yet, but I'm patient. And I'm happy with how things are going!

I've been on this sub every day and I read through everyone's questions and answers as much as possible to keep learning. This is such a wonderful community and I just wanted to give thanks to each and every one of you for your help on this journey :)"
"Not new to Paleo but it's been awhile.... I've eaten the Paleo diet in the past but usually in the end got lazy (mostly because of whiskey. lol) and ended up going back to a ""normal"" diet over time. This time (it's been since January 1) I'm determined to keep it. I have ALWAYS felt better eating Paleo - always. And there are so many products out there - mostly from Primal kitchen, but there are others, that are specifically designed with this lifestyle choice in mind. I don't call it a diet because to me that is a bad connotation. It IS a lifestyle choice, for sure.

I also quit drinking on the 1st (believe me, no easy task). Got back into a regular workout routine and since then have dropped 20+ pounds (about 10 to go) and feel better than I have in years. 

I think turning 60 last year had something to do with my decisions here. The number alone scares the crap out of me. I've heard that after 60 things can go downhill REAL fast if you don't take care of yourself - work your body and your mind and eat right, etc...

I'm here for good.... I know my lifestyle and food choices NOW are going to make all the difference for me for the rest of my life, which I hope is considerably longer. :-)

I am also about a month or so away from starting P90X again (haven't done that in several years either) but I'm working my way up to it. Go Paleo and eat healthy my friends!"

"Help please. Need to tweak something. Can‚Äôt figure it out. On standard keto 6 weeks now for fat loss/weight loss. Meal prep, weigh and track pretty darn strict.

I stay away from packaged keto snacks and foods. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù. Started at 191 down to 177. The loss so far I‚Äôm assuming is water loss not actual fat loss. I weigh myself everyday after I‚Äôve used the restroom and before I‚Äôve consumed anything. Some say don‚Äôt weight yourself everyday. For me I do it cause it just helps remind me what I‚Äôm doing and where I am. It‚Äôs a reassurance thing for me. For 2 wks, I‚Äôve been stuck at 178 and 177. Did keto before and I remember the weight loss was a consistent down trend for me wk after wk of 1lb+. What can I tweak? Is there something I‚Äôm missing? Does my expectations just need adjusting?"
"coffee/tea syrups? I used to have a latte (or 3) every day. 1 cup of lactose free milk, 1 shot of espresso, brown sugar and vanilla. It was my morning ritual and what used to calm me down from an stressful work day (I have adhd and coffee calms me down and makes me sleepy) 

I switch over to black tea since I could no longer feel safe while driving if I had coffee before and it still was perfect. 

Then, nutritionist had me switch to paleo.. I can't find a substitute for it, I was able to kinda tolerate almond milk, but I can't find a sweetener.   I don't like coconut so coconut sugar is out of the question. I don't like Stevie either. Monkfruit is the closest I have found to white sugar but nothing close to brown. 

I have not had coffee or tea in days and I'm kinda desperate, it's cold and I want something warm to drink in the mornings. 

I tried making a simple syrup with monkfruit sugar, water and vanilla but it crystallizes... any tips?? 

I like my drinks really simple and not time consuming.. im just looking for tips and ideas to try out with my morning coffee/tea

Thanks!!"
"Grilling season: favorite vegetables and seasonings used Hey All,

"Just keep swimming 
After a major hiatus from taking care of myself whatsoever as life got a little busy and I kept making every excuse possible, IM BACK! 

Started eating right (strict Keto) and going for roughly three runs a week, the weight has been falling off! I started at 216.5 on April 10th and weighed in at 198.8 this morning! 

I am eating at a deficit, but a reasonable one (roughly eating 2000 calories a day) with the only processed foods being cheese, salad dressing, and sour cream.  

I‚Äôve done keto on and off for the last 10 years with great success every time I go all in! Just happy (probably from the endorphin high from my run) with the progress and want to let all those other trying it for the first time‚Ä¶.just keep going!"

"Egg Fast - overall weight loss but body fat percentage gain and muscle mass decrease To start off, my experience with keto started when I was 200lbs (19F). I did it over the course of 8 months and then dropped to 120lbs.

Over the course of 4 years I‚Äôve put on about 15lbs and am wanting to nip it in the butt before it gets worse. 

I‚Äôm currently on day 3 of an egg fast that I‚Äôm using as a jumpstart back into the keto lifestyle and have lost about 5lbs so far. 
While this sounds amazing, I did an InBody scan and learned that I‚Äôve actually put on roughly 2% body fat since starting and have also decreased in muscle mass. 

While doing the egg fast I have also incorporated 20 minutes of StairMaster followed by about 40 minutes of lifting weights. I had started this about 2 weeks before my egg fast and have continued to do the same regimen while on my egg fast. 

Over the last 2.5 weeks I have seen an increase in the amount of weight I‚Äôm able to lift so I‚Äôm a bit confused as to how my body fat has increased and muscle mass has decreased. 

While weight loss is always my main goal - I am looking to get more toned, I don‚Äôt want to be skinny fat. At my best, I was 123lbs and 19% body fast, and I would love to get back into that range. 

Any tips given the information I‚Äôve provided? Thanks in advance!

(P.S. I know the InBody scan isn‚Äôt 100% accurate, but it is the only form of measurement I have accessible to me at this time and I am okay with it being a ‚Äúrough estimate‚Äù as to where I‚Äôm at)"

Stepped on the scale today and just instantly broke down, &amp; I just feel defeated because Nothing is working for me and it makes me want to give up in a sense because it sucks to put your all into something and get no results.

3) I hate meal prep. Is there any place where I can buy ready lean meats that will not cause me to go completely broke?

4) Are there any decent tasting paleo-friendly foods that I can buy at a local supermarket?

5) Should I slowly introduce this or should I go right into it? Thank you!"

"Help with electrolytes? Hi, I‚Äôve read the FAQ on electrolytes but I‚Äôm still struggling pretty hard with what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing. From my meals that I eat, my daily intake appears to be 1500mg sodium, 1400mg potassium, and only like 100mg calcium. I don‚Äôt know how to calculate magnesium since it doesn‚Äôt appear on any of the nutrition labels.

I guess I can pretty easily add more sodium to my diet by adding salt to my meals (apparently pink Himalayan is best?). But I‚Äôm struggling with how to add more potassium, calcium, and magnesium. I can‚Äôt really figure out what foods to eat to get these electrolytes but not add any more carbs? Should I just drink a ton of those LMNT things?

Sorry if this has been asked a lot, I just have read a lot of information and it all kinda confuses me and I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to get my electrolytes in balance :("

"Milestone Hi All, wanted to share a little milestone....pre-Keto, I was a size 20-22. Have been steadily going down in size, as of last week my size 16's were falling down.....so, I thought maybe a 14 was in order next. Just this morning, I was in Target and found a cute pair of jeans on clearance, and I tried them on - they fit, and - SIZE 12 BABY!

"My (F45) Partner (M45) doesn‚Äôt agree with the Keto diet Okay I know this might sound a bit weird but I had been doing Keto for a year and had great results in my opinion, I, 5‚Äô6 was 150lbs and went to 132lbs in about 8 months, not a lot but I wasn‚Äôt fanatic. I felt happy with the results and since we both love to cook, I really put an effort into selecting recipes, which he disapproved of.. 
We are LDR and are very happy about that, other than this I can‚Äôt think of any problem we have in our relationship. 

So during summer I reached my goal weight of 120lbs and he claims it would make me look older if I were to continue and it‚Äôs ‚Äúall a load of c**p since we just need to eat healthy, which we do anyways.‚Äù
The problem is that when he is around he does most of the cooking but he refuses to compromise on the carbs. He is adamant it‚Äôs not a good diet.
 I have tried to explain the benefits: I have no hair loss (with my age it comes and goes), no knee pain (I had a knee injury that healed but kept on being a problem but completely vanished on Keto), my blood pressure is much better. 
I don‚Äôt know how to communicate it to him that I would love to do the Keto and the healthy foods we eat, but just no carbs. 
An example of a dinner would be steak, veg, salad and fries. I f I were to say beforehand I don‚Äôt want any fries..oh no..

"Still have acne on Paleo diet‚Ä¶did anything help? So I thought going Paleo would help my skin since I basically cut out all added sugars, grains, flours, processed food, etc. i eat mostly fish, chicken, eggs, pork, veggies, fruits, nuts and seeds and even cut out tofu (I‚Äôll have it like once every 2 weeks now) I rarely have cheat meals and maybe once a week will have an almond milk that I mix with Orgain Superfoods protein powder.  I‚Äôve been doing Paleo for almost 4 months. 

So I eat pretty clean and I‚Äôm still getting acne.  Mine is mostly around my chin/upper lip area so I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs hormonal. Most are closed comedones that turn into cysts but some are the under the skin cysts to begin with.  did anyone improve their skin with the paleo diet or do you still get acne? My hair got much thicker and healthier (even my hair dresser commented on how much thicker my hair is now) but my skin is still a struggle.

"""Breakfirst"" Cocunut Oil + C8 MCT Oil + Fish Oil Capsule Hi,

I am basically doing ~~OMAD +~~ KETO since 1 month now and already can feel the differences. I am not doing it for weightloss but rather mental clarity and less fatigue during the day.

Sometime along the way I started scooping some coconut oil in the morning. Later I added MCT oil, now I am swallowing fish oil capsules as well. Very fast ""breakfirst"" in the morning, just one scoop and one capsule. Are there any downsides of this? Anyone else consumes a bit of fat in the morning?

"An Epic Tale: Introduction to Histamine Intolerance: I can eat very little except for fresh meat. Dear beautiful and beloved eaters:

The purpose of this post is to educate, inform and spread awareness in order to reduce suffering.

Approximately 1% of the population is histamine intolerant; many don't know it.

Histamine is a component of many healthy foods, including many fresh vegetables and processed meat.

I have had a wide variety of chronic health conditions for much of my adult life, notably chronic migraine and irritable bowel.

Due to supply chain issues, we started purchasing more canned goods, and doing more canning. We were already making our own sauerkraut and fermented vegetables.

Very very slowly as I increased my intake of canned goods in response to supply chain issues, my health deteriorated further.

My symptoms included:

migraines (vomiting thousands of times, smell, sound and light sensitivity, scintillating scotoma (temporary partial blindness)

irritable bowel

dry skin

insomnia potentially due to histamine

constant state of nausea

and many more.

I was monitoring a long hauler sub in order to witness and understand worst case scenarios. I noticed that a subset of long haulers believed they had become histamine intolerant and they found adopting a low histamine diet greatly improved symptoms.

So, I decided to try it. upon cessation of high histamine foods, symptoms improved acrosss multiple systems immediately. My gut became a metronome; it appears that after a quarter of century my irritable bowel is completely gone. Cured. I am healed. My energy levels increase on a daily basis. My sleep seems more healing. I've lost 10 pounds in two months, and it looks like I've lost 25 pounds due to reduction in fluid retention and bloating from histamine. I'm able to reduce my migraine medication for the first time in years. My clothes hang off me. I can see my cheekbones again. These are all a good things.

Essentially, all processed meats and a wide variety of fresh vegetables are off the table. Fresh meat and a variety of fresh vegetables are on the table. All fermented foods, alcohol, yogurt, kefir are off the table as fermentation increases histamine. Most canned and dried food are off the table, although speaking generally it may be that dried food has more stabilized histamine levels than canned. Examples of fresh vegetables I can not eat are: tomatoes, spinach, avocado, eggplant, edamame

Differences in processing make a difference in histamine levels. Some kinds of canned beans and lentils are off the table. Some kinds of dried beans and lentils are on the table, if they are properly soaked.

This article studies canned fruits and vegetables. It concludes that histamine levels generally increase in all canned foods over time (not just fish), with hotter temps increasing histamine

"Plateau after a month Hi all,
Today I am 35 days in. I'm 5'9"" and started at 150.4lbs. The lowest I've hit is 145lbs and now seem to have plateaued. Feeling fed up. Adding some details below in case anyone can advise. I am trying to stay below 20g net carbs

Food: I eat a lot of cheese, bacon, sausages, steak, chicken, tinned tuna, avocado, eggs, ham. I also bought low carb bread/rolls. I often hit 20g carbs but not enough protein or fat. 

Drinks: coffee with cream/1 stevia and 0.5 tsp sugar (cut down from 2.5tsps of sugar!). 3 glasses water most days (i know this isn't enough). Have had perhaps 4 days since i started that I have drank- spirits and diet soda or prosecco. 

Electrolytes: 1 electrolyte tablet a day

Exercise: 5k run every Saturday morning that I struggle with. Resistance class/weights once or twice a week. 2 days a week I will hit 10k steps a day, on other days arpund 3k steps. Generally feel tired with activity. Before keto I used to do a lot more exercise.

"I am back and I don‚Äôt want to mess up this time Alright. I‚Äôve tried keto before. It was good at first but it went down hill and caused extreme binge eating.

I‚Äôm assuming this was due to 

1. Too many sweeteners/keto ice cream/protein bars

2.not eating fiber

3.eating wayyy too much cheese/nuts/calorie dense foods

Other possible factors 
4.electrolytes?
5.Water?

This time I have a plan. Obviously it‚Äôs not exact but here it goes

Morning:
-Cup spinach

-100g mushrooms

Some kind of protein/fat to cook with the veggies such as :cheese,salmon patty,eggs 

-1-2 tablespoon chia seeds with cup of cashew milk with 1-3 tsp sugar free sweetener

Lunch: nothing crazy. Just turkey pepperoni or something to snack on.
Maybe 2 if I get hungry. Has lots of sodium

Dinner: I meal prepped a side of veggies and ground beef. If I am still hungry, I will have another one or another pack of pepperoni. But I will not have an extra one of these if I had that other pack of pepperoni from earlier 

After dinner I will have another chia seed drink

This gives me 1200-1800 calories depending. Net carbs for sure under 50 but I‚Äôm keeping them under 25 just to be safe.


I will have 1-2 energy drinks as needed, but hopefully will change to coffee

My sodium is enough. Potassium is low so I will supplement potassium and magnesium.

Will try to drink lots of water

The differences I see from doing it this way than previously is:

 the only sweeteners I am having are the energy drinks and a few teaspoons for my chia drink. No keto ice cream or keto chocolate or binge eating quest bars. Maybe gum here and there

I am eating more meat than cheese/nuts and other calorie dense foods. I am kind of over this ‚Äústuff yourself with fat‚Äù bullshit because very fat dense foods do not make me full. Pepperoni will. Pepperoni has fat but it has more protein than fat. I can‚Äôt eat cheese and nuts all day.


I am eating more fiber. Thanks to chia seeds. I am hoping this helps

I forgot how I was doing on water and electrolytes last time I did keto but I don‚Äôt think it will be an issue since sodium
Is good and I just have to supplement the other two.

Yes I am eating processed foods but I‚Äôm a busy person and i like quick and filling snacks. 

What I remember from when I failed was that I was BINGE EATING cheese and also having Turkey with it. Most of the fiber I got were from protein bars I think. And I would eat keto ice cream and protein bars everyday. At first I did well but idk why eventually I broke.I was always bloated and felt disgusting (also because of sugar alcohols) and was having like 30 pieces of gum. I really hated my life

I just want tips. I am trying to maintain this as much as I can. I am on an adhd medication to help my appetite but I‚Äôm hoping I won‚Äôt need it as much. I want to do keto because I wanna maintain my weight more easily, I want more energy, be less bloated, more mental clarity and more productive and I‚Äôm addicted to sugar. When do cravings go away? When do I get energy and mental clarity ? Any advice and answers is appreciated."
"How do I get more calories and gain weight? Because of IBS, I started doing keto which eliminated almost all of my symptoms. But I'm trying to gain weight, not lose it. I'm roughly trying to target 2,500 calories; I weigh \~61kg and am 5'6.

I have access to lunch at work every day where I can generally have as much meat as I want but if I have too much I'll get excess protein and get kicked out of ketosis. (this might seem unlikely but usually I consume around \~2lbs of meat and would ideally have like 4 if I could which seems like it'd very likely kick me out of ketosis)

I've thus been trying to eat lots of meat and then use [keto fuel](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/) for the rest of my calories but keto fuel still has too much protein to let me have all that much meat. Is there a way to get most of my macros/micros from protein and then just get the rest from fat? I'd drink avocado oil if there were a palatable way to do so; any recs on how to get straight fat calories?"
